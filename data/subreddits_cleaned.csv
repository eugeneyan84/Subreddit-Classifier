Ditching Alexa,"I’m really getting tired of the Alexa integration always asking me to sign in again. I never use Alexa for voice or to control devices anymore. I figured I can setup almond or something on its place.

My main questions are these two:

1) what is the experience like when using Almond (or another local option)?

2) what speakers would be recommended? Just cheap, small speakers that I may occasionally play synchronized audio throughout the home?

I’m pretty crafty with node red and use it for all of my automations.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-28 04:19:07,Ditching Alexa,"I’m really getting tired of the Alexa integration always asking me to sign in again.

Peanut Plug Firmware Upgrade Tutorial -ZHA,"We finally have a way to upgrade Peanut Plugs with the firmware that fixes the power reporting w/out having to buy an almond router using ZHA   


I found the tutorial on github to be super confusing, but I figured it out so here's the workflow that worked for me.   


First steps: make folder called zigpy\_ota under the config directory. The file path should be:  /config/zigpy\_ota   


Grab the firmware from the last post in the github thread and throw it in that directory.   
[https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/419#issuecomment-667109912](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/419#issuecomment-667109912)  


Update your config .yaml to include ota: and the directory. Mine looks like this (Redditt does weird things to the spacing/indentation, please adjust accordingly) :   


zha:  
  zigpy\_config:  
network:  
channel: 15             # What channel the radio should try to use.  
channels: \[15, 20, 25\]  # Channel mask  
ota:  
otau\_directory: /config/zigpy\_ota  


Set logging details:  
logger:

  default: info

  logs:

homeassistant.core: warning  
homeassistant.components.zha: debug  
bellows.zigbee.application: info  
bellows.ezsp: info

zigpy\_xbee.zigbee.application: info  
zigpy\_xbee.api: info  
zigpy\_zigate: info  
zigpy\_znp: info  
zhaquirks: info  


  


Reboot HA  


Open up a terminal session and tail the log with this:  
 tail -f /config/home-assistant.log   | egrep OTA   


Next, go to the Plug in ZHA and get the IEEE Mac under device info, then go into Dev Tools and go to services. Use the ""zha.set\_zigbee\_cluster\_attribute"" service and this into the Service Data section and then press ""Call Service"".   


ieee: 'Peanut IEEE from Device Info'  
endpoint\_id: 1  
cluster\_id: 5  
attribute: 2  
cluster\_type: out  
value: 49502  


After a few seconds you should see log entries like this:

These will increment again and again until 100% You should do this with the plug close to HA or it will take a LOT longer. It takes about 5-10 minutes for each upgrade with it close by,

"Hey Home Assistant squad! With Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales in full swing, what protocols are your go-to to purchase in 2020?","2020 seems to be the world of WiFi or Zigbee - but I'm curious to hear from the community's perspective: what are your go-to protocols for security and user experience? 

Currently, my whole home mainly consists of WiFi devices (mostly Tuya). Once you're able to get familiar with home assistant, I've found that these types of devices are very easy to customize and automate within HA. That said, there are some problems I've found with Tuya devices in particular, namely no-brand = lower quality (but for the price, maybe still worth the replacements vs Zigbee devices in the long run), and also potentially less secure with so many devices talking directly to the Internet (currently looking into VLAN as a solution though).

For what it's worth, I've started creating custom ESP32 devices that utilize MQTT to go into an even more secure (100% localized) route. It truly looks like it's my favorite communication method to get into, although there aren't many (if any at all) consumer products that you can buy with MQTT off the shelf :)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-27 21:59:50,"Hey Home Assistant squad!

Two-Factor Issue/Missing App Options,"Haven’t messed with HA in a few months aside from an occasional update. Lost my phone, and it wasn’t backed up recently, so I can’t log in because HA is no longer showing up in the Authenticator app.

My wife still has access on her phone, and I tried to turn off two-factor. But I can’t see options like configuration, etc. I assume that’s because she’s not an admin?

At any rate, is there any way to fix this using her app, or am I SOL? 

I assume the next step is to access the configuration file on my server directly and edit the code to turn two-factor off?

I've just bought a load of IKEA tradfri stuff for the first time,"I have my home assistant set up to work with Zigbee and I've tested it by connecting 4 Philips hue bulbs although for some reason it won't pick up the traffic stuff which seems a little odd considering it is marketed as working with other Zigbee hubs whereas hue is known for being a pain in that respect, so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to why this may not be working or how to fix it?

just for clarification, I'm using ZHA to manage my Zigbee and the radio is the Texas Instruments based radios with Z-Stack any help would be much appreciated and I plan to post the results of anything that does not work in an edit after it's fixed so others can use it (too many times have I found posts about stuff like this and they don't post the solution it's really annoying)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-27 21:06:09,I've just bought a load of IKEA tradfri stuff for the first time,"I have my home assistant set up to work with Zigbee and I've tested it by connecting 4 Philips hue bulbs although for some reason it won't pick up the traffic stuff which seems a little odd considering it is marketed as working with other Zigbee hubs whereas hue is known for being a pain in that respect, so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to why this may not be working or how to fix it?  just for clarification, I'm using ZHA to manage my Zigbee and the radio is the Texas Instruments based radios with Z-Stack any help would be much appreciated and I plan to post the results of anything that does not work in an edit after it's fixed so others can use it (too many times have I found posts about stuff like this and they don't post the solution it's really annoying)",151,13,"I've just bought a load of IKEA tradfri stuff for the first time I have my home assistant set up to work with Zigbee and I've tested it by connecting 4 Philips hue bulbs although for some reason it won't pick up the traffic stuff which seems a little odd considering it is marketed as working with other Zigbee hubs whereas hue is known for being a pain in that respect, so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to why this may not be working or how to fix it?  just for clarification, I'm using ZHA to manage my Zigbee and the radio is the Texas Instruments based radios with Z-Stack any help would be much appreciated and I plan to post the results of anything that does not work in an edit after it's fixed so others can use it (too many times have I found posts about stuff like this and they don't post the solution it's really annoying)",I've just bought a load of IKEA tradfri stuff for the first time I have my home assistant set up to work with Zigbee and I've tested it by connecting 4 Philips hue bulbs although for some reason it won't pick up the traffic stuff which seems a little odd considering it is marketed as working with other Zigbee hubs whereas hue is known for being a pain in that respect so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to why this may not be working or how to fix it just for clarification I'm using ZHA to manage my Zigbee and the radio is the Texas Instruments based radios with Z-Stack any help would be much appreciated and I plan to post the results of anything that does not work in an edit after it's fixed so others can use it too many times have I found posts about stuff like this and they don't post the solution it's really annoying

With Cyber Monday coming up ... What is your idea of the ultimate Smart Home TV?,"Currently looking for a new TV and wondering which Smart TV setups are out there, are recommended, or integrate well with Home Assistant. Please share your experiences!

Help with MQTT Setup for Tasmota Sensor PMS 5003,"Greetings!

&amp;#x200B;

I have been able to connect PMS 5003 to Wemos D1 mini and obtain some reading. However, I do not use auto-discovery with my mqtt. Is there any way for me to set up my configuration.yaml in order to send information from D1 Mini to my mqtt broker and then to Home Assistant?

Using mqtt explorer I am able to capture the data that D1 mini is emitting, however, I don't know how to make sense of it to connect it with HA.

Automating Roku to launch specific content,"Is it possible to control the Roku remote to navigate to in-app menus and start specific content?

1. ""Hey Siri, start Morning TV"" - Turns the TV on -&gt; Launch NewsOn app -&gt; Go to Favorites tab -&gt; Starts specific news show
2. ""Hey Siri, start TV\_SHOW"" - Turns TV on -&gt; Launch Plex -&gt; Clicks Play on TV\_SHOW

Use an 'Entities' Card to change a lock code on a door - data to a service,"I am just learning home assistant.

I have installed on a RaspberryPi3B and have a [zwave.me](https://zwave.me) usb dongle.  The zwave integration is working well.

I have a kwikset 912 lock **that I can lock/unlock, and I can set the code(s) on it using the Developer Tools &gt; Services**.  I use the ""lock.set\_usercode"" service to set the code with data (example):

`node_id: 2`

`code_slot: 3`

`usercode: 7731`

I created a script to call this service, and I am having a problem getting data from the UI to this service.  If I leave the values hardcoded, the call to the service works:

`alias: set_lock_code_2`

`sequence:`

  `- service: lock.set_usercode`

`data_template:`

`node_id: '{{node_id_v}}'`

`code_slot: '{{code_slot_v | int}}'`

`usercode: '{{usercode_v}}'`

`mode: single`

`variables:`

  `node_id_v: 2`

  `code_slot_v: 3`

  `usercode_v: 7731`

But I am having trouble creating a 'card' for the entry of information and passing it to the service.

I set up an Entities card with fields (helpers) to enter the data.

`type: entities`

`show_header_toggle: false`

`entities:`

  `- entity: input_number.lock_code_slot`

  `- entity: input_number.lock_code`

  `- entity: script.set_lock_code_2`

`name: Set Door Code`

`title: Set Scottish Room Door Code`

However, when I replace the hard-coded values in the script with what I *\*think\** needs to be there, the script is no longer called.  I see no output in the logs.

`alias: set_lock_code_2`

`sequence:`

  `- service: lock.set_usercode`

`data_template:`

`node_id: '{{node_id_v}}'`

`code_slot: '{{code_slot_v | int}}'`

`usercode: '{{usercode_v}}'`

`mode: single`

`variables:`

  `node_id_v: 2`

  `code_slot_v: input_number.lock_code_slot`

  `usercode_v: input_number.lock_code`

I feel like I must be missing something pretty basic.

What can I choose b/w Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop vs Wyze vaccum keeping HA in mind.," Hello Experts,

This will be another BF deal request , thanks for your patience in reading it.

I  have pre ordered Wyze vaccum cleaner which costs $199 and I see a BF  deal for Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop in amazon, which is  coming for $350.

can someone help me choose the right to me?

1. currently  I live in an apartment, and we are looking for homes, so we will move  sometime later. I currently have Carter and wooden floor  lives in 2nd  floor.
2. If I but now, I really do not want to change at least for 5 yrs.
3. I  do see there is huge difference in price, but I wanna choose privacy  over price - I mean, I know both are Chinese brands(not really sure abt  wyze) but with what I know Xiaomi vaccum can be flashed to use locally  with MQTT so it will not contact the any cloud servers w.r.t Privacy. I was reading [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/giipq3/which_robot_vacuum_to_chose_for_full/fqg0zam?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I hope this is applicable for s5 pure as well. Can you guys please confirm?
4. Mopping is really not needed, but S6 has it as a bonus, I might use very less times.
5. any other points if I should consider?

Thank you for your time.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-27 20:58:16,What can I choose b/w Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop vs Wyze vaccum keeping HA in mind.,"Hello Experts,  This will be another BF deal request , thanks for your patience in reading it.

Template Help,"I've been banging my head against the wall over this for a bit now. I'm trying to DIY a thermostat type deal for my newborn son's room using a small room heater on a Shelly controlled socket, and a temperature sensor that can be adjusted using a slider in Lovelace. I think a template is the way to go about it, but my Google-Fu isn't strong enough (I'm a solder jockey, not a programmer). I feel like if someone explained why this doesn't work and how to fix it once, it would click in my head (but I've overestimated myself before). I'm just trying to pull a boolean state to turn the heater off once it reaches temp.

    {{(state_attr(input_number.luke_s_room_temp_set) | float + 2) &gt;= (state_attr(sensor.lukes_h_and_t_si7021_temperature))}}

That returns "" UndefinedError: 'input\_number' is undefined "". That value should be defined by the value of the slider in Lovelace right?

If anyone has a more elegant way to go about it, I'm all ears too. Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: The hardware and MQTT is all in place with a humidifier as well to regulate both the temperature and humidity in the newborns room. Once I figure out a way to regulate the oxygen content and barometric pressure, I'll really be cooking lol.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-28 04:18:08,Template Help,"I've been banging my head against the wall over this for a bit now.

Netatmo integration suddenly reports lots of unavailable entities,"Over the course of the last week, I noticed that something has happened with my Netatmo integration.

Everything goes smooth and there are no errors logged. After successfully re-creating the Netatmo integration, all entity names are still different from the names I have used in my automations.   
**In addition; several unavailable entities are listed!**  
These are entities like *WiFi, Battery, Trends, Reachability* etc. of the climate (weather stations) that I have.  
These are not orphan entries from any previous integration, I know - because when I deleted the Netatmo Integration they all vanished, and then returned again as soon as the Netatmo integration was re-created.  I know for sure that I was able to read the battery level of the outdoor module earlier, because I have an alarm automation for it. Now, bttery level it is listed as an unavailable entity. But entities such as temperature, humidity, CO2 etc, are still readable.

(I have reported the same question to Netatmo, but they just point at the creator of the Partner App - as they call it)",Netatmo integration suddenly reports lots of unavailable entities Over the course of the last week I noticed that something has happened with my Netatmo integration I discovered this because several automations based on temperature readings stopped working Upon closer look it turned out that many not all of the Netatmo entity names had changed causing automations to fail Long story short After trying everything including several restarts and also re-install of HA I deleted the Netatmo integration restarted HA again and re-created the Netatmo integration from the UI Everything goes smooth and there are no errors logged After successfully re-creating the Netatmo integration all entity names are still different from the names I have used in my automations In addition several unavailable entities are listed These are entities like WiFi Battery Trends Reachability etc of the climate weather stations that I have These are not orphan entries from any previous integration I know  because when I deleted the Netatmo Integration they all vanished and then returned again as soon as the Netatmo integration was re-created I know for sure that I was able to read the battery level of the outdoor module earlier because I have an alarm automation for it Now bttery level it is listed as an unavailable entity But entities such as temperature humidity CO2 etc are still readable Do any of you have any idea why the Netatmo Integration suddenly reports a number of unavailable entities I have reported the same question to Netatmo but they just point at the creator of the Partner App  as they call it

Stupid question - how do I configure the action to send the email as an alert,"short version - I have Home Assistant up and running. Sensors connected and reporting temperature and water leaks. I can test with the developer tools my [notify.gmail](https://notify.gmail) and it all works fine. Last job is to connect them together (temp below 50 degrees send me an email and let me know current temperature that triggered the alarm). When I configure the automation it says that the UI does not support this (picture attached).

Stupid questions (you were warned)

Am I in the correct area to even configure this? Should I be using Node Red or hand editing a configuration file? If so - is there a guide or youtube video walking me through this? I would also accept just type in these three lines. :)

Also it would be smart if I could 'group' all the temperature sensors and leak sensors to generate alerts rather than configure them individually.

Hope everyone had a good thanksgiving. :)

Best option for white dimmable LED strip to control with z-wave?,"Goal: Dimmable LED strip for behind TV (will stay at that setting but I want to pick that dimming level, otherwise I would just use a z-wave plug) 

I see the Fibaro which I could pair with a simple white led strip to dim but I feel like that's overkill. Anyone find something with maybe a oldschool potentiometer on the strip itself? Set it once and incorporate into my family room scenes as on/off

If I do under counter lighting for my kitchen I would use the Fibaro or equivalent to set different light level output for different times or day and/or just scene controlled. I would like those lights on at night but nice and low, but obviously full blast when cooking.

Automation triggering by sequence,"So I'm having great fun with [Aqara Cube](https://www.aqara.com/us/cube.html), connected to my HA via [CC2531](https://www.itead.cc/cc2531-usb-dongle.html) and [zigbee2mqtt](https://github.com/danielwelch/hassio-zigbee2mqtt).

So, for example, my AC only turns off if I do the following sequence in a correct order (within a timeframe of 5 seconds): 

shake the cube

tap the cube

rotate the cube anticlockwise

Thermostat Card doesn't update,"I have my Google Nest Thermostat connected to HA and a thermostat card on my home screen. The card doesn’t seem to really ever update, though.

How do you build a sensor based on change-over-time?,"I've long since figured out simple 'if' statements and the usual mathematical operators... but I'd really like to have my home greet me on dark nights by turning on the porch light *before* I get into the driveway and without having to push any buttons.

I have a good GPS feed that updates my position every third of a mile, and I'd like to set up a sensor that can trigger my house lights under a circumstance like ""distance was over 1 mile in the last five minutes but is now under half a mile"".

I have SQL skills, so I plan to add a table in my MariaDB database that's constantly calculating the distance between my phone and my house, and I know how to turn a SQL query into a sensor... I'm just really fuzzy on how to even start on the final logic.

If there's no easy way to do it in HA script, I guess I can bake it all into SQL, but I'd like to know if there's an HA method before I start on that.

Can you trust Home Assistant to mange through power failures and interruptions?,"I do not have the ability to analyze Home Assistant's containerized architecture, but I am struck by:

    - How long it takes to boot up on the RP4 platform (in my case with 8GB memory)
    - How long it takes to shutdown
    - How many times I have had to restore from snapshot because 
        * Either I have turned the RP4 off too soon and hosed the micro SD or worse.

I realize that I need to take the appropriate precautions around this containerized platform, but a Windows machine survives very well the kind of insensitive to idiotic treatment that would be end-of-life for a Home Assistant system on Raspberry Pi.

I originally bought a Vera Edge unit for my Z-Wave but found the management of Z-Wave with HA better, especially with the Zooz ZST10 Z-Wave 2 USB plug-in device.  It is awesome.

Now I am worried about leaving a Raspberry Pi 4 for a weekend in case there is an interruption or other disturbance in the Force and am wondering, in general, about the fragility of this setup.

There was a pretty frank series of observations that met with too much ""true believer"" reaction for my comfort:

https://community.home-assistant.io/t/help-hassio-is-dead-after-power-outage/117938

Now, I am thinking I would be better off to use my home ESXi setup and a Home Assistant VM rather than a vulnerable Raspberry PI.  At the very least I can remote in and fix the Home Assistant VM!  But after spending the day trying to pass the Zoos USB stick through to the HA virtual machine, I think I have to go back to an external controller I can talk to via Ethernet.

If I could fix my Raspberry Pi remotely, without buying a $100k robot to re-image and switch out the Micro SDs, I would probably not not be worrying about changing platforms.  Right now, I do not see a 5 9s performance happening with a RP4.  (99.999% reliability has long been required by law for landline telephones, and I think it is normal to want something close in a home monitoring system.)

I do have a UPS, but I worry I am not up to repairing damage to an HA instance except by rip and replace and that means changing out the Micro SD.

My biggest question is can Smartthings or Vera provide me with the HA devices I need to build automations for being  away?

It Begins...,"Yup - another migration story. Feel free to skip.

I started with SmartThings as a Kickstarter backer. Over the years it's been mostly OK but things have slowly started to get less smooth. About once a year I have to repair/rejoin a bunch of of devices. Samsung took over and account migration, app changes and then the V1 hub stops getting updates. Realizing this is no longer a secure configuration for a network facing device I start looking at options.

The obvious easy path was the newest SmartThings hub but one thing that has always irked me is the latency inherent in the system. Lose your internet and everything fails to function. Adding to all the legacy irritation a couple of cloud based services move to a paid service model. ST hasn't done so but I can see it happening in the future.

So I start researching and hunting. As a longtime Linux/Open Source user I tend to gravitate to that model due to the community support. Home Assistant keeps showing up in my searches. Weeks of researching and weighing options I decide to pull the trigger. Fuck Samsung - let's go HA.

A RPi4 and a HUSBZB-1 later I'm ready to. A bunch of false starts, mostly tied to removing/resetting clients from ST. I managed to get a basic system running with about half the clients online and starting to get a feel for how it works. And then - nothing. Seems I missed the memo about Hassio being a little rough on SD cards. (Lesson One - snapshots, make and save them)

Sigh... OK, let's start again. New SD card until the M2 and USB enclosure show up. Most everything rejoins effortlessly and I'm able to set up the rest now that I have a handle on how to use HA to exclude zwave clients that ST still had a hold of. 

This time everything joins cleanly. Even my gen1 ST door and motion sensors come on line. I can set up a simple dashboard and basic automations. It's not the most elaborate system you'll see here but it works for me. It's lag free and under my control. Finally.

It's easy once you know what you're doing. Getting to that point took a couple of rounds of wrong turns but it's nothing like the warnings I heard.

Setting IKEA Tradfri LED1624G9 RGBW bulb to its hardware warm white LED,"I recently got an IKEA Tradfri RGB bulb to experiment with Zigbee lights, as the ESPhome-flashed Tuya stuff I currently use just don't get bright enough RGB-wise.

For the ESPhome bulbs, I have 2 sliders and a color picker available in the web UI, one slider for brightness and the other for ""White value"", so I can do stuff like slightly tint the white the bulb's warm while LED puts out. The IKEA LED however only has brightness and color, and I cannot seem to get the bulb's warm white LED to light up like it did when it was just paired, all I get is some slightly tinted cold white from what I presume to be red green and blue LEDs mixed.

How do I get the bulb's warm white LED to be controlled separate from the RGB? Or at least how can I easily set the bulb to its initial warm white? I gotta mention I use ZHA for my Zigbee stuff.

Solution for Multiple ZHA Integrations (Remote Home Assistant),"I've posted this as a reply elsewhere but though others might find it useful..

I've got 2 Sonoff Zigbee Bridges flashed with Tasmota. 1 for the house and 1 for the Garage (there's a significant distance between the 2).

I was pretty bummed that you can only have one ZHA connector in HA.. so my solution is this.

Multiple HA instances.

I run Proxmox, so it was easy to spin up a second HASSOS instance using Whiskerz007 script : https://github.com/whiskerz007/proxmox_hassio_lxc

Once that was up, i went about making it functional.. enabled the websocket API, creating a long lived access token, installing HACS and the Google Backup addon..

And then on my other (main) instance i installed Remote Home Assistant : https://github.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote

Now I have 1 Sonoff Bridge connected to my main instance for my house devices, and 1 connected to the other instance for my Garage devices..

MY main interface is able to pull anything published in the garage one through to my main interface seamlessly.

You can even use nodered to talk to the devices via the main instance and it'll be redirected.

It's awesome.. I believe they've tried to get a PR put together to add it to HA natively but the code was messy and was denied.. but hey.. it works for me and means i don't have to decypher MQTT topics for my second controller.

Hope this helps some one!",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 23:42:10,Solution for Multiple ZHA Integrations (Remote Home Assistant),"I've posted this as a reply elsewhere but though others might find it useful..

Hue Play Lightbar as status indicator.,"Hello guys,

I’m here today with a special question. At our company we have multiple server rooms and we want to use the Play Lightbar at the top of the server racks indicating the status of the most things in it. For example: If some low priority service is offline the Lightbar is still green but flashing yellow maybe every 1 minute. Or if the whole system is shutdown (test racks) or some high priority service crashed the Lightbar is red. Would love to be able to use scenes for animations. 

My question: what we need for this? Is this possible with home assistant by using pings / port checker or http checkers? Is there maybe a better way to do this instead of using home assistant? 

Would love to hear some answers. Really searched the whole internet for something like this but it seems the most of people doesn’t want to have fancy stuff in their server rooms. We’re already have a touch display in every rack wich shows running services as cards wich indicate the status but since we don’t have glass doors you still have to open the door to see what is going on.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 15:46:40,Hue Play Lightbar as status indicator.,"Hello guys,  I’m here today with a special question.

Z-wave or Tasmota Wifi,"I  am running HASS and looking to add a large number of dimmers and  switches (moving my C4 to HASS).  My existing HASS devices are all WiFi  tasmotized or otherwise MQTT devices.   I have a very good WiFi system.  I like being independent of some company's cloud service.

How to achieve smooth dimming with IKEA Dimmer,"Would appreciate if someone can point me in the right direction. Not sure if I need NodRed or some custom .yaml file to achieve this.

* I got [this](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/tradfri-wireless-dimmer-white-10408598/) IKEA dimmer today.
* I paired it to my Conbee device via deconz using the Phoscon GUI.
* I can see the dimmer now in home assistant under ""devices"".
* I created a few automations (turn off/on, dim+/- on long press) using the GUI in the home assistant.

The issue is that the dim on long press only dims 10% at a time and I'd like continuous dimming. How can I achieve that?

I looked at [this](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/here-is-a-good-method-for-dimming-lights-in-deconz/138115) tutorial (and others) but I don't have any groups or lights in deconz.

Need ideas for enabling/disabling remote access to my home network when I leave/return home,"Despite my confidence in the security of my setup, I’d still like to further reduce my home network’s exposure to the internet by disabling remote access while I’m at home.

Is that something HomeAssistant can do? How?

I have port 443 on my FreshTomato router forwarded to that VM.

Which raspberry to choose,"Hello,
I'm currently thinking of trying home assistant. For the moments I only have two WiFi light bulb and I've got a temperature sensor which work on ZigBee. I'm also thinking on buying some more sensors for plants informations, led strips and also adding diy projects from esp8266.
I would use home assistant to have everything on the same app.
So to use home assistant I'm thinking of buying a raspberry and add a usb ZigBee dongle but I have difficulty to choose between the ones actually available.
I don't want to spend much and I'm not thinking of adding a lot of devices (10-15 max) and not cameras or others high demanding things. So I've searched on AliExpress and I have 4 choices : 
 - Raspberry zero Wh for 15€
 - Raspberry pi3 b+ for 34€
 - Raspberry pi4 2Go for 35€
 - Raspberry pi4 4Go for 52€
I think the pi3 is a bad idea because the pi4 2Go seems to have better performance for the same price but I'm not sure. So can some one help me to choose a device based on the numbers and types of devices I'm going to use please ?",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 17:19:19,Which raspberry to choose,"Hello, I'm currently thinking of trying home assistant.

ZHA: Is there a way to force state after reconnection / power failure?,"Hey everyone,

I'm using a flashed Sonoff ZB bridge with the ZHA component.

I have some sonoff zb switches and aqara lamps installed in light fixtures that are connected to a physical switch.

* Is there a way to set the ""power-on state"" of those zigbees, the default state they will have after the switch is flipped off and back on, or after a power failure?
* Is there a ZHA event i can use as a trigger when a device rejoins the network, so i can have HA do it?
* If this is not possible with ZHA, is it perhaps possible with Z2M? and can Z2M work with the sonoff zb bridge?

Thanks in advance!",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 08:17:27,ZHA: Is there a way to force state after reconnection / power failure?,"Hey everyone,  I'm using a flashed Sonoff ZB bridge with the ZHA component.

Lidl has released Zigbee 3.0 certified smart home gateway/hub and devices,"Lidl (the German international discount supermarket chain) has just released a Zigbee 3.0 certified smart home gateway/hub and many Zigbee 3.0 devices under their Silvercrest brand with low prices.

Samsung family Hub (smart fridge),"Hi folks, looking at Black Friday deals, and wondered if anyone had any good use cases of what is possible with the Samsung Family Hub on their smart fridges?

It works with smart things so wondered if anyone had tried:

1. Display lovelace (need casting?)
2. Can you cast any camera in the right format to the hub (if I add the camera from HA to smart things?) ie doorbell that isn’t a Samsung camera but in HA?
3. Does it respond to other inputs/direction - like google home (not bixby) like play music on the fridge? 

Trying to decide if it would be as useful as it could be with HA (I see there is an integration that pulls sensors etc)

Force Refresh Data From Eve Room?,"I’ve connected an Eve Room with an Eve Extend and gotten Home Assistant to be able to view the devices ([following these instructions](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-homekit-integration/221003)), but sometimes they will go days without updating (and I know the numbers have changed because I can view them on the device itself).

Does anyone know how I can force Home Assistant to refresh the data for these devices?

Specifically, I would like to refresh air\_quality.eve\_room\_b109 about every 15 min.

Right now air\_quality.eve\_room\_b109 was updated 15 hours ago, but another number (sensor.eve\_room\_b109\_humidity) on the same device, updated two hours ago.

I’ve tried creating an automation to update the device, but it doesn’t seem to do anything:

VLAN setup for Home Assistant and other devices,"I am a newbie to VLAN and I am trying to figure out what hardware I need to achieve the outcome I want.

I have about 40 IP devices in my network and I have categorized them as

1- Devices that only require internet Access (cheap iot devices and camera that connect to cloud but can't be accessed locally)

2 - Devices that require only LAN access and NO internet access

3 - All other devices such as laptops and phones and home servers that require local and internet access

I am in the market for a mesh wifi system and am planning to buy a TP-Link system which supports one Public Wifi SSID and one guest Wifi SSID. I assume I can put devices in Category 1 above to the guest wifi and they will have only internet access and no access to my local devices. 

For the remaining 2, my understanding is that I need a VLAN to separate out the traffic. I also know that the TPLink doesn't support that. 

My questions are

1. Do I need a firewall/router type appliance such as a pfSense to acheive this (I guess yes). 
2. I understand I can create firewall rules that prevent traffic from going from one VLAN to another. But I have stuff like Airplay speaker that should be local only, but I should be able to play to them from my phone. I assume this can be done by allowing only certain ports and devices access between local vlan1 and local vlan2 while blocking out everything else 
3. This part is where I have a gap. How do I assign specific devices to specific VLANs ? Tutorials in youtube are Ubiquiti focussed and suggest having a separate SSID for each of those categories of devices. In my case, that is not possible as I can only have two SSIDs. How would pfSense put those devices in specific VLANs. Would I have to configure each device separately based on it's MAC address?

Any help or even a pointer to a youtube post would be much appreciated.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 08:22:12,VLAN setup for Home Assistant and other devices,"I am a newbie to VLAN and I am trying to figure out what hardware I need to achieve the outcome I want.

"Trane XR524 Z-Wave Thermostat ""Unavailable"" &amp; Temperature 0.0","Preemptive apology if this is a new ""*newbie*"" question - I literally started using HA **today** (*moving over from SmartThings*). (**TL;DR at bottom.**)

* zwave.thermostat
* climate.thermostat\_mode

I already attempted to unpair / pair again with the same result.

Best way to control Somfy RTS window covers?,"I've decided on Somfy for window coverings in my house, and I kept them all on the Somfy RTS protocol. FWIW they do seem to have some support for direct z-wave or zigbee integrations, but I don't think it's easy to do with every motor type, it's more expensive, and doesn't seem well supported. I want it to still be functional if my home network gets borked so their native RTS seemed like a safer bet.

So far a few of them have arrived and been installed and I couldn't be happier, they work well with the native somfy remotes, and the motors move very smoothly and are very quiet.

Anyway, from here it seems like there are multiple options to hook it into Home Assistant:

1. Somfy myLink device, it that looks like it has support in HA but it's a cloud service which I'd always rather avoid if there's a local option. I'll eventually have 8 total coverings I believe, and these myLink devices only support 5 channels each so I'd need to buy 2 of them.
2. There's a Z-Wave to Somfy RTS converter, it's more expensive but supports 16 channels so it'll work out about the same. It would be local, but not I can't really find much in the way of reviews of this so not sure if it'll be reliable.
3. There's a Somfy universal control that looks intriguing, but I can't tell if it'll be easy to integrate with HA or not. You send it serial rs232 messages over ethernet which I haven't worked with before. It also has pretty mixed reviews, some people claim the antenna is bad so it doesn't communicate reliably with the somfy motors, but then some people claim once you replace the antenna it's good.
4. Apparently more generic 433 Mhz radios can work like the RFXtrx433E, but it seems to be no longer produced it's out of stock everywhere I see it online.

Anyway, looking for input from anyone else with Somfy RTS motors. Are you using any of these options, and how does it work for you?",r/homeassistant,2020-11-25 22:28:35,Best way to control Somfy RTS window covers?,"I've decided on Somfy for window coverings in my house, and I kept them all on the Somfy RTS protocol.

Remove color temperature ability for Hue Lux light connected through Zigbee2MQTT?,"I have a Raspberry Pi 4 running Home Assistant, and I have connected a CC2531 Zigbee USB stick to it so I can create a network of Zigbee devices.

Migrating from CC2531 to CC2652 (ZZH) lost some devices,"I recently migrated from a cc2531 to a CC2652. Stable, fast, and I'm less worried about it breaking :D 

Running Zigbee2MQTT.

BUT, while my Livingwise  scene controller devices paired initially, they had no output from the buttons. After trying to re-pair one of them, it won't even appear in the logs as trying to pair. 

My LVS-ZB500D devices (similar) won't pair now either (fresh from the box) 

Before I go too deep into any rabbit holes here, are there incompatibilities with devices connecting to a newer 3.x.0 firmware on my coordinator? I would hope that Zigbee 3 is backwards compatible.

A Wake Up Lights - sharing setting,"I have configured a *Wake Up Lights* that may be useful to someone.

**Faetures**

* turns on defined lights at specific time - via Lovelace
* only when a specific person is at home - based on specific *device tracker*
* all days or working days only - via Lovelace
* can be conditioned by the sun angle for dark, gloomy etc. - via Lovelace
* set a timer to turn lights off after x minutes - via Lovelace
* this automation can be deactivated - via Lovelace

*Note: Pavel is a name of person*

Continuing with my humble home-made security system: alarm siren speaker now,"Hi again. I'm about to make an order on Amazon but the last step, for now (this hobby never ends), is a battery-powered alarm siren speaker. It'll be hidden somewhere. It needs to be loud. In case I buy a UPS in the near future, so that both the router and the Raspberry Pi + ConBee II will continue to work in case a burglar turns off the power of the apartment or something, even if there's no power in the apartment the loud siren will sound as soon as a burglar enters.

Is it possible to create a template(?) sensor with attributes defined by templates?,"Recently they changed the recycling system in my area so that instead of just two bins, we now have five. From before I had two `rest` sensors that utilized the same API endpoint and extracted their states from the response JSON. For just two sensors, that was fine.

Now that I'll need five sensors, I'd very much prefer to just send one API request and extract all five values from the same JSON response. Optionally, I could have multiple sensors and maybe use an automation or a script to set their values. I guess that route would make it easier to display the dates in separate cards?

Any ideas? I should mention that I haven't touhced Pyscript or AppDaemon so far, but if someone could give me some pointers I'd certainly give it a shot.

Would this bluetooth Eufy Smart Door lock be a huge paint to integrate with HA?,"The lock in question is the [Eufy Smart Lock](https://imgur.com/a/uBKAI7r) with fingerprint sensor.

The reason I ask is because this lock is ""smart"" in that it ONLY works with Bluetooth from their app.

Originally, I thought this would not be too tough to integrate, I could use a Bluetooth to MQTT gateway and integrate it like that. There are many examples of this from cheap sensors.

But then I thought, it may be a lot harder than those other examples due the most likely increased security of the lock itself. I would assume they put some sort of extra layer of security to prevent someone from sniffing the bluetooth and sending commands to the lock.

Repurposing old devices with HA,"Hi everyone, I'm very new to HA but I've got it all setup thanks to some handy walkthroughs on YouTube. Thus far I've only got some very basic things setup like my ecobee, Google Devices/Spotify, and external access from both my SO and I's phones via DuckDNS. 

I'm not really sure what else to do and quite frankly the options are overwhelming... I'm thinking of potentially making some of my plugs and light switches ""smart"" as well as exploring some camera setups this Black Friday.

"Okay, looking for cameras to pick up wildlife...","Hi!

So I live in a rural area, and we have tons of wildlife around our property. Foxes, bears, cougars, bobcats, etc. and I'd LOVE to capture them on video (for funsies). 

I'm having a hard time nailing down a plan for cameras, because obviously I'd like it to double as a security cam setup, and also link to HA, but I honestly have nowhere to start. 

I was eyeballing the blink cameras on-sale now, but they say they only really have a 20 foot activation range, and that might not be far enough at nighttime. 

Anyway, thoughts? I'm willing to spend a little money, or build out a rPI system to manage the video storage, but I really have no idea where to even start.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-25 19:27:23,"Okay, looking for cameras to pick up wildlife...","Hi!

I'm having a hard time nailing down a plan for cameras, because obviously I'd like it to double as a security cam setup, and also link to HA, but I honestly have nowhere to start.   I was eyeballing the blink cameras on-sale now, but they say they only really have a 20 foot activation range, and that might not be far enough at nighttime.   Anyway, thoughts?

AI for filtering out false positives in surveillance video captures," While this is not directly related to HA, I know that many of you are using cameras with your HA set up.  If anyone knows of a better place to ask this question, please do direct me.

I'm running motionEye as my NVR for my home surveillance system. This software works pretty great for motion detection but at night it gets a lot of false positives due to bugs/spiderwebs/etc in my video captures. While hard drive space is cheap, it does add up and makes going through these captures fairly tedious and time consuming.

I know that solutions do exist (Doods/Deep Stacks) that are able to identify cars/people/animals in photos. The problem with this is that parked cars also trigger a positive detection. Truth be told, I have been running an AI set up with Blue Iris for a while now and while it does work, I end up having to mask out areas for parked cars and when these cars move or others show up, it defeats the purpose.  I was running BI in a Docker container under Linux and while that also works, it does take up a lot more resources and is limiting me on adding additional cameras.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if anyone can tell me if there is something like Doods/Deep Stacks that is able to detect moving cars/people/animals in a capture? If so, I could script something that would process the recordings to see if it had something I was interested in and keep it or delete it otherwise.  I do not need this done in real time.  The ability to eliminate false positives from recordings would greatly reduce the amount of space needed for storing these clips and would allow for me to keep more of the clips that contain the objects I'm looking for.

Any help in this is most appreciated. All the best to you!",r/homeassistant,2020-11-25 15:38:24,AI for filtering out false positives in surveillance video captures,"While this is not directly related to HA, I know that many of you are using cameras with your HA set up.

Communicating HVAC System,"Next spring, I plan to replace my HVAC system: Furnace and AC. I have two zones which are controlled by ecobee3 thermostats. I’ve been generally happy with these thermostats, and I was hoping to keep using them with new system. However, I learned that the most efficient and green systems are now all controlled by proprietary communicating thermostats. For example: regular thermostat cannot control modulating furnace gas valve, and only is able to do two stages. The same for AC: no variable speed compressor control, only up-to two stages.

I found the following incompatible HVAC systems from various manufacturers:

Unifi Integration stopped working,"Hello, This one has stumped me for a few days. I had the Unifi integration working great for a few months using it for presence detection. I noticed earlier this week it stopped updating statuses, and all the entities showed in error. I rebooted, removed, and re-added the integration several times. I've confirmed the controller is functioning. The controller recognizes the login from HA on it's end, but shows no devices or entities.  I turned on logging and believe the relevant bit to the issue is below, I'm just struggling to decipher it. Any help would be appreciated. 

Edit: FIXED! Unifi controller was in need of an update.

Help with MQTT integration,"Absolute HA noob here, I'd appreciate some help with the following:  


I have a bunch of esp32s doing some control and  publishing different sensor data via mqtt to a raspberry pi running HA with mosquitto. They are added via the config file, for example:

switch:  
 - platform: mqtt  
   name: ""Extractor fan (building)""  
   command\_topic: ""building/fan""  
   state\_topic: ""building/fan/state""  
   availability\_topic: ""building-AG1/available""  
   payload\_on: ""on""  
   payload\_off: ""off"" 
   payload\_available: ""online""  
   payload\_not\_available: ""offline""

My issue is the following, if a node fails it should become unavailable in HA, however it will stay available until i restart HA (for weeks). this is obviously due to the fact once it dies it can't publish that it is offline to the availability topic. Is there a way to set a timeout or something for mqtt devices so they are marked unavailable if they don't publish to the avail. topic regularly? Or any other workaround? (or i am definitely just plain dumb and just missing a setting).

Questions about Alexa integration and network requirements.,"Looking to clear up the network requirements for Amazon Alexa/Google Assistant integration for voice control of devices such as switches and the like.

Based on the HA documentation it appears that I can do this without a subscription if I open up port 443 my router to fwd to the HA.  If I am already using port 443 for another purpose (like a secure web server using standard ports), then I would not be able to set this up.  Is that correct?

The Home Assistant Cloud is the alternative.  This is a subscription based service that would NOT require me to open any specific inbound ports as the communication channel is established by outbound connectivity to the HA Cloud API.

What i'm aiming at is that when i enter my house the display lights up so i can enter my code. Is there an windows based client for home assistant that can achieve this?

Recreating my Snapshot,"My SD card failed. HASS wouldn’t start. I yanked the card. Put it in my PC and was able to copy the files off. Got a new SD card. I have now have a new clean install...but can’t find a snapshot to reload. I do have the files I salvaged.

I tried copying the files to the new SD card, but it didn’t seem to load the original image.

Zwave capabilities when using Smartthings integration,"Hi all,

I'm just getting started with HA, and I'm currently using the Smartthings integration to bring my  Zigbee and Z-wave devices into HA. I'm planning to eventually buy a dongle and move over completely from ST, but I'm hoping to get some experience and familiarity first, because I've installed and abandoned HA about 5 times due to the learning curve.

I'm curious how much control I have over my Zwave devices with it integrated this way, specifically if I can put lock user management into effect for my Schlage BE469 lock, and scene control for my Zooz Zen27 switches.

I've done some googling on scene control for the switches, and what I've found indicates I need to edit my zwcfg file, which doesn't exist since the switches are integrated through smartthings rather than paired to a dongle.

I haven't yet looked into the lock user management end..

Anyone have any feedback as to what's available and what's limited by integrating Smartthings?

Giving up on Amcrest Doorbell - thinking DIY,"I am giving up on the Amcrest doorbell for now and returning it. Since I have a covered front porch, the deep shadow on faces at my door unfortunately makes it unusable. As I said in another post, it was fine when I placed my hand over the sensor to force the brightness to shift, but there is no way to do that manually. Additionally, if you disable motion detection notifications in the Amcrest app, it disables the doorbell press notifications. So it is all or nothing.I also understand that they restricted their API due to Duhua restricting theirs (maybe that's a rumor) - I have concerns about further development in HA. I wanted to ask about this on the Amcrest sub, but that sub is restricted and looks dead.

I have two Wyze v3 coming which I hope to use as a video feed for my door due to a better sensor and aperture, but they are still working on firmware for RTSP ([https://wyzelabs.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051619871-Does-the-v3-support-RTSP-](https://wyzelabs.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051619871-Does-the-v3-support-RTSP-))

&amp;#x200B;

What I eventually want:

1. Someone approaches my door. I get a notification and Facebox/Doodz sees if it recognizes them. This is separate from #2
2. Person pushes the doorbell button. If I am home, Alexa TTS that someone rang the bell. I get a notification on my Android phone that someone is there and would I like to answer or ignore them. If I answer, it opens a 2-way audio/1-way video call  (video both ways would be great down the road - like a teleconference call). If I ignore them, TTS asks them to leave a message and then starts a recording from the camera to be reviewed later. It records for 30 secs or so, then TTS makes a beep sound. Like an answering machine.

&amp;#x200B;

My current thoughts with equipment at hand:

1. Aqara switch mounted below the Wyze v3
2. Push switch - notification goes to our phones that someone pressed the doorbell. We open the Wyze app and use that for 2-way communication

This would be a $25-$35 solution (depending on where you get the switch. Cams were $20). It's not pretty and fully integrated, but should be better than my current $80 doorbell.

Future thoughts:

If the RTSP firmware is released, I can add it into BlueIris and I can use motion detection and feed it back into Facebox. I can also have an flow that triggers the ""answering machine function""

Hopeful thoughts:

My understanding is that 2-way audio is still an issue with HA. I watched the hackershack video where they used a RPi 3 that would launch Jitsi. this could be a cool approach, however I would end up using a different camera (Wyze did enable webcam mode, but I don't see that working here or with the new v3). None of the Pi cameras looked like they would work for what I want (good low light, IR for night, and good normal light streaming when not in use as a video doorbell). Also, as I can't see for a way to have Node-Red auto-launch a teleconference software on a RPi and ask if I want to join a conference from my Android phone - this is just a pipe dream.

Issues with sensors coming thru Smartthings,"The hub for my network is Smartthings. I've integrated it with Home Assistant because I like the fine level controls I have over my smart home. Smartthings is a pretty reliable hub, but has a horrible interface.

This isn't just one type of sensor, either. I currently have several, such as the Zooz 4-in-1 sensor and a Xiaomi temp/humidity sensor. Both are showing the same behavior.

Ensuring Z-Wave plug state by monitoring power draw?,"Hi!

I've got a Fibaro Wall Plug 2 controlling a heater and have set it up using `generic_thermostat` platform. This mostly works well - except when it doesn't.

Occasionally, Home Assistant thinks the plug is turned on when it really is off. I can solve this by manually turning the switch off and on again (via Home Assistant). The problem is that by the time I discover this the temperature may have dropped by several degrees.

I'm not sure how this can even happen considering the plug is Z-Wave Plus certified, but figured a possible solution is to set up automations for toggling the switch (twice) if the power draw of the plug doesn't match the reported state.

So if Home Assistant turns on the switch, but power draw remains below some low threshold, turn it off and back on again. Perform the power draw check again, and so on. Similarly, if Home Assistant turns the switch off but power draw remains above some threshold, turn it on and off again.

This would most likely work in my setup because the heater is always set to a high temperature that its internal thermostat will never measure. However, it would be nice to have some kind of failure detection where Home Assistant won't trigger these automations endlessly if something changes (heater setting is changed, Z-Wave switch is offline, etc.).

I'm having trouble envisioning the required automations to make this all work smoothly. Ideally, I'd like for it to mostly function by itself and only notify me if something goes wrong. Maybe something along the lines of notifying if a specific automation has been triggered more than x times in the last y seconds. Or maybe combine that with a dynamic interval (for checking the power draw) that keeps increasing every time the ""fix"" doesn't work.

--------------

Anyway - would like some guidance on how to set this up efficiently.

Im Going To Do It!!,"In 6-9 months I will be purchasing a house and I want to be prepared to start my home assistant journey. I have so many questions, but I am going to try to keep it clear and concise.

Second - I have already decided I am going with Zwave. Where should I get sensors, plugs, etc from? Thinking Zooz for switches.

Third - Want to set up security devices so what cameras and equipment do I need for that?

Lastly? - Do you have people/articles that you recommend for getting introduced to and starting HA? I know there are going to be a ton of obstacles ahead so I will need to learn those from someone/thing (MQTT, Nodered, HACS, etc.)

Mysa thermostat integration - how to,"I finally got a Mysa thermostat for my in wall heaters in the main room. This heats half our home, so it was worth the cost to me.

It seemed like there was some confusion on how to set these up in HA based on reading older posts, so here is what I did, and it worked perfectly.

1. Download the Mysa app, create account, verify email, etc..
2. Install the Mysa according to your wiring (240 vs 120) &amp; power on
3. When the Mysa screen shows the big down arrow, it's in pairing mode. Open the Mysa app and follow instructions. Choose a 2.4Ghz SSID that Mysa will connect to and and enter the password. Allow phone access for what it asks for.
4. WHEN IT'S COMPLETE, **DO NOT HIT CONFIRM!** Every time I did this, the device was no longer discoverable in HA via the Homekit Controller.
   1. UPDATE: NEWER FIRMWARE VERSIONS MAY NOT REQUIRE THIS STEP.
5. In HA, if Homekit did not find it already, add a Homekit controller integration and on the dropdown select your Mysa device.
6. The Pairing Code is behind the screen of the Mysa. When you install the Mysa you have to remove the screen to install  the mounting screws. on the back of the screen panel is a QR code. Next to that is a 8 digit number. Pay attention to the format - the Homekit integration is telling you to enter the pairing code formatted like XXX-XX-XXX - this is important! Make sure to use the dashes.
7. Once the Mysa is paired in HA via the Homekit controller, go back to the Mysa App and confirm that setup is complete. So far I have full app control, and full HA control.
8. Add a climate card to the UI and test it out.
9. Use the Mysa app for more advanced settings like screen brightness.

When the setpoint is changed on the Mysa device, it updates in HA. When the setpoint is updated in HA, it updates the Mysa display. Same with the Mysa App. It all works.

If you run into any issue at all, reset the Mysa by holding up and down arrows on the screen for 10 seconds.

You DO NOT need any other Apple devices do use the Homekit controller integration.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-24 02:05:49,Mysa thermostat integration - how to,"I finally got a Mysa thermostat for my in wall heaters in the main room.

AC status in homekit," 

Hi,

Previously I had my daikin AC Wi-Fi module integrated through homebridge that showed on home app of it was cooling or heating. After moving to the home assistant integration of homekit and connecting the daikin ac to home assistant it always shows as green (doesn’t say if it is cooling or heating).

How can I solve this? I would like to be able to have the AC status showing correctly in the home app.

Ways to sense which Echo Device is Active?,"I think that one of the holy grails of smart home voice control is being able to issue location specific commands to a voice assistant like Echo. I have several echo dots placed all over the house, and one of the first things I did was place them in groups so that commands like ""turn on the lights"" only turn on the lights in a specific group.

*But for some ungodly reason that doesn't work with any other devices.* I desperately want to say ""turn on the tv"" and have only the tv in the room I'm in turn on. Same with ""open the blinds."" I haven't found any sources online where someone has managed to make this work.

Is there any possible way to get the active Echo device into an HA script via a custom Alexa skill? Anyone have this working? I have found no solutions on the software front myself.

Maybe a workaround could be sensing the power draw of each Echo with power monitoring smart plugs? Does anyone have experience with this, or know whether smart plugs detect changes in battery consumption fast enough to make it relevant to a running script?

Ikea Tradfri remote: can't use with HA via Tradfri gateway?,"Hi folks.

I just bought the Tradfri kit of three bulbs, a gateway and a remote to play with. Integration into HA was super simple but one of the things I'd like to try out is using the nifty remote to control non-Tradfri stuff I've got hooked up to HA.

It sounds like I could do this with ZHA and a serial dongle to do the Zigbee stuff, but not via the Ikea gateway. Is that correct?

The only thing that shows up for the Tradfri remote in Home Assistant is a sensor showing the battery life on it. Nothing I could use to drive automations of scene changes or the like.

"Am an existing Homebridge user, will Homeassistant be more suited to my needs?","I'm currently using Homebridge on a Pi in order to expose my 2015 (I think it is) Samsung Tizen powered TV to be visible in HomeKit, which I then use an automation to turn on the lightstrip on or off depending on its power state, the TV is too old so I can't even use HomeKit to turn the TV on/off either!

My hallway IKEA Tradfri lights are activated by either IKEA Tradfri switches and Hue motion sensors.  

I have a load of HomeKit automations which set the brightness depending on the time of day it turns on (100% bridge between sunrise and sunset and 33% bright 4 hours after sunset to sunrise), is this something I can automate with Homeassistant so the birghtness level at 10pm is 100% and as time goes on, by midnight, it will only activate at 33% then in the reverse at sunset, it will go from 33% to 100%.

Also, what happens if HA is unreachable and I switch the lights on, does it not work as HA is not reachable or does it just turn on regardless?

I'd also like to use https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting as I think IKEA are dragging their heels on supporting adaptive lighting as Hue have only just enabled this in the UK but I don't even know where to start.

For example, the MyMazda app will notify me if my trunk/doors are open, but I'm not always on my phone, so it would be nice if when I get a notification from MyMazda saying my car door is open, it would announce it through my Echo(s) and maybe flash my LIFX lights? Is this possible? I'm assuming the answer has something to do with Tasker...but I don't even know where I'd begin with being able to do this.

Of course I'd also like to branch out to other apps, like when I get a text from a certain person (or a snapchat) my lights flash, etc etc. There's a million uses but the Mazda one is my first focus.

LIFX integration error - bulbs unavailable,"Hi there, everyone

I posted this one in the HA Forum, but this community seems more active, so hopefully I'll score some help.

My LIFX bulbs have always been kind of unstable, but for the past few weeks it has been worse. My log is giving me some errors that I cannot understand, so I’m asking for some support from anyone that is more knowledgeable than me.

 [Here](https://hastebin.com/movinepoko.sql) is the log.

Some more details, if needed:

* Routers are 1x Asus AC88u (main) and 2x AC68U (AIMesh), al running MerlinWRT
* LIFX app works without any issue
* Tried removing/reinstalling the LIFX Integration - no luck
* Tried resetting all the bulbs - no luck
* Running Home Assistant on a Linux laptop (Docker)

All my bulbs are LIFX and this has been driving me insane, so huge thank you for your help in advance.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-24 00:03:04,LIFX integration error - bulbs unavailable,"Hi there, everyone  I posted this one in the HA Forum, but this community seems more active, so hopefully I'll score some help.

File Editor keeps changing file format,"Hi everyone!

I've had this issue for a while, but I recently found that it is actually breaking some of my automations. I use the web UI for the official File editor add on to edit my automations. Now, I've noticed that when I log back in sometimes, my automations are formatted differently in terms of arguments for some services. For example, I will type out

\- delay: 5

but sometimes when I open the file up it's been changed to 

\- delay: '5'

Other behavior also happens with some of my templates, which breaks them. I'm hoping someone knows something about why this is happening, or at least how I can stop the editor from modifying the file.

Problems with Bromite browser and webview on remote Android clients connected through Caddy reverse proxy. Looking for some help.,"I've narrowed down my problems to [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/).

I can't connect to my Home Assistant from any android client when trying to access it through my Caddy reverse proxy when using the Bromite browser. I have one rooted device that is using the Bromite System Webview, which makes it not possible to access using the companion app.

However, all of the devices in question have access when using the local IP address (192.168.1.XX:8123) in Bromite, and they all have reverse proxy access when using a different browser (Fennec and Vanadium, for examples).

When I navigate to my DDNS that points to my reverse proxy, Bromite will let me log in, but Home Assistant will quickly eject me and say ""Unable to connect to Home Assistant.""

Below is my reverse proxy configuration using Caddy v2. Note that I use the same header and encode settings to access other stuff on my local network (Sonarr, Radarr, Portainer, Jellyfin, Nextcloud, etc.), and all of those work fine, even in Bromite. I've tried changing the encode and header directives, but haven't found anything that changes the weird login behavior.

Is anyone using Bromite that could give me a point in the right direction? Are there any settings I should check? I've compared my Bromite settings to my Vanadium settings (another chromium-based browser that works fine when accessing Home Assistant), and they look the same. I've already tried disabling the adblocking in Bromite, which should be the primary difference between those two browsers.

I'm not sure what is making Home Assistant act different from my other services on my reverse proxy. Is there anything in my reverse proxy config that could be causing this issue on a single browser/webivew?

Anyone using Emporia Energy Vue to Monitor Home Energy Usage?,"I was saving up money to buy a Sense, but the reviews have me iffy. 

I was researching other options, and when I came across a post about the Aeotec home energy monitor, someone mentioned this product.

Looks like I can get a version that has 16 50A clamps for circuits and 2 200A clamps for the mains. 

We have a newer home (built in 2017). Everything is labeled, and 16 clamps should be plenty to monitor what I want to watch in the house.

I also came across the python repo, and this HACS integration (which has to be manually added):

I'm thinking that for $150, this really fits the bill. But I'd like to hear from some of the folks out there using it.

"Dumb switch with relay ""multi toggle"" action","Does anyone else use smart relays behind traditional switches, but want multiple actions from toggling a single dumb switch? 

I wanted to be able to turn on a main light by switch, OR have it also turn on the side lamp by the couch with a quick on-off-on toggle of the switch. I use a Shelly 1 behind the light switch. This could be done with almost anything though.

Here's what I did, but wondering if there is a better way?  This works well for me.

**1) Create a helper counter.**   
Default 0, max 2. Call this Toggle Counter or something.  it will count the toggles to the 'On' state.

**2) Create an automation to increment the counter +1**  
Every time the relay goes from off -&gt; on, you want the counter to +1, but not forever.  
Mode = parallel   
Trigger = when shelly state changes from off to on  
Action = increment the counter - call service -&gt; counter.increment   
Action = delay 5 seconds  
Action = reset the counter - call service -&gt; counter.reset

This means you have 5 seconds to flip the switch off-on again before the counter will be incremented from subsequent toggles, because you are resetting the counter back to ""0"" five seconds after every off-&gt;on action. Adjust delay as desired. 5 seconds is long, 3 should work well too. Mode= parallel allows the automation to run again without stopping the first one, so the first one will still be counting down the 5 seconds delay and reset to counter to 0 for a fresh start. For example, if it only counted 1 toggle in 5 seconds.

**3) Create another automation for your what to do when a double flip is detected**  
Trigger: When the counter changes state to 2  
Add conditions if you want.  
Action: reset the counter to 0 - call service -&gt; counter.reset  
Action: call your service for whatever action you want. I have another living room light come on with the second toggle.

With the parallel mode and the counter resets, you won't have a situation where you turn the light on later on have the secondary action trigger. You just have a few seconds for the toggles to count.

You will need a seperate toggle counter (helper)  for each switch you want to use this one. 

Anyways, this was one I hadn't come across before - and is sort of a hybrid where smart automation meets manual control.

Could be useful for something like opening the garage door as you walk into the garage with a quick double flick of the light switch too.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 19:46:00,"Dumb switch with relay ""multi toggle"" action","Does anyone else use smart relays behind traditional switches, but want multiple actions from toggling a single dumb switch?

Any way to run HA in High Availability configuration when using Z-wave?,"As the title implies, my HA install manages my Z-wave network. Currently I am running it with [Hass.io](https://Hass.io) on a RPi 4, but would prefer to move it into my Proxmox cluster to take advantage of live migrations, fully automated backups managed by Proxmox, much more durable storage, etc. The only issue I have is the fact that I need to have the Z-wave stick mounted to the VM to managed the Z-wave network. Mounting the USB stick isn't a problem, but if the VM is moved/failed over to a different physical host, the physical stick cannot follow.

Will this work?,"Hi, this is my 1st time posting. I have Home assistant with 100+ devices connected to it using Rpi4. I just bought a UPS back up power just to avoid my rpi cut off from power. My home power occasionally tripped(not sure why, and not always, however it tripped 2 nights ago before i bought the UPS, thankfully my rpi home assistant started up fine, phew!)

So i made an automation in node red that if my sonoff switches become unavailable (few switches, the only way i know if there is a power trip due to my network will be cut off due to it) it will then check an input boolean if its on(using helper input boolean named auto shutdown rpi) if its true or on then it will continue on and switch off that input boolean and continue again to call service to shut down the rpi.

The main reason i put input boolean(named auto shutdown) is to avoid the rpi to shutdown again after booting it up incase the switches(sonoff switches) is still connecting to the network and still unavailable. 

This is not tested yet. Question im asking is, will this work? My ups system is not a smart ups. it just continues on powering the appliances connected to it if power fails. and if power fails i wont be able to access my home assistant due to rpi will not be connected to the network(no power) so i made this automation to shut it down automatically.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 12:57:44,Will this work?,"Hi, this is my 1st time posting.

And, since I already have two Zigbee devices (Xiami/Aqara) working with Conbee II + Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi 4, I thought it could be useful for it to be Zigbee, and not Wi-Fi, so this way it could act as a Zigbee signal repeater and hopefully bring the Zigbee signal further into the other side of the apartment so that I can get more and more Zigbee devices in other areas of the apartment in the near future.

What to use for commercial garage door opener,"I have a commercial garage door opener in my shop that is the Liftmaster MT. It uses a 3 button wired remote (Open, Stop, Close) that is wired into the com, open, stop, close ports on the main unit. It has a black learning button which I have been able to use without issue in pairing with my vehicles.

I have tried the myQ hub but their software works with several different colored learning buttons but does not list black as an option. Their phone support said they don’t think it works with their “commercial” openers.

My attached garage uses a GoControl which I recently got working however it being 2 wire I didn’t see how that would work with the Shop opener.

Any ideas on what I can use to open/close and monitor the status of the door? I would prefer a wifi solution as I have wifi in the shop however would consider a zwave product but would need to add a hub. My HA and zwave dongle are not within range of the shop.

I have started looking at the shelly 2.5 but wasn’t sure if that will work or even the best option.

Thank you in advance.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 15:55:12,What to use for commercial garage door opener,"I have a commercial garage door opener in my shop that is the Liftmaster MT.

ZHA: Aqara battery reporting,"Hey everyone, 

I'm using a flashed Sonoff ZB bridge with the ZHA component.

I have noticed that the aqara/xiaomi motion, contact sensors and buttons all report 100% battery, except of two of them that report 92%. (I'm using the old xiaomi versions of the sensors)

I tried searching everywhere but I cannot find a solution to this, not a recent one that I can follow.

Wrong Colour on IKEA Trådfri bulbs,"Im using HassOS 5.4 with Supervisor 118.x and latest Deconz using Conbee II.

When i change color i get the wrong colours. Yellow is greenish and blue has a weird tint. It worked well with the Trådfri gateway integration.

Zwave/Wifi/... Thermostat,"I'm searching for something, but I cannot find the thing I needed. Or not enough information to know if it does what i want.

I'm building a complete system for my central heating using home assistant and some custom electronics. The system work with 8 central valves allowing hot water to flow through the radiators.  At the moment I have different 5/6 zone's. This al works fine from within home assistant ( took my long enough :p )!

To have I easily accessible for my wife and kids, I want some thermostats to install in my house. These are the features I'm looking for:

* Wireless
* They can send the current temperature of the room to home assistant
* Able to change the target temperature from the thermostat and send it to home assistant
* Allow home assistant to change the target temperature and send it to the thermostat. So you can see on the thermostat what the target temperature is.
* I would also like the ability to change some status icon's on the thermostat. 
   * Is the room currently been heated?
   * Is the valve open?
   * ...

I have no need for a relay or schedule in the thermostat itself, because all of that is been taken care of in home assistant.

Hopefully somebody has an idea :)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 07:41:45,Zwave/Wifi/... Thermostat,"I'm searching for something, but I cannot find the thing I needed.

How to make this automation work with kodi's weird behavior?,"I have an automation that runs a lighting script when kodi starts playing music (and only music, not videos). The trigger is a state change of media_player.kodi to ""playing"" from any state. It has a condition to check that the state attribute 'media.content_type' is 'music.' this all works as expected so far.

The problem comes when switching from one song to the next. If song1.flac is playing and finishes then song2.flac starts, the state of media_player.kodi stays at ""playing"" throughout the track change and the automation is not re-triggered. But if song1.flac is playing and I skip to the next track, kodi's state briefly changes from playing to idle then back to playing. That's enough to re-trigger the automation, potentially sending too many service calls to my yeelight bulbs in too short a time if I'm skipping several tracks.

How can I work around this? Use something else for the trigger? Is there a way to ignore momentary state changes? 'idle' is also the state used when kodi is stopped so I can't ignore that state completely, only when it's been in idle for less than 1 second then changes to playing.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 11:12:38,How to make this automation work with kodi's weird behavior?,"I have an automation that runs a lighting script when kodi starts playing music (and only music, not videos).

Struggling with strings in ESPHome display lambda,"Hi folks.

I'm trying to pass through a string into my epaper display but I'm struggling with C++ string handling. I admit to knowing not nearly enough about C++ so I'm blundering my way through here with copypasta and little understanding.

All I want is to get the current weather state onto the display. I've got floats like temperature and humidity working great.

So I've defined a string (well it sure looks like a string, current value ""rainy"") sensor as:

    sensor:
      - platform: homeassistant
        entity_id: sensor.openweathermap_condition
        id: openweathermap_condition

And then I go to use it in the lambda:

    display:
      - platform: waveshare_epaper
        update_interval: 60s
        cs_pin: 15
        dc_pin: 27
        busy_pin: 25
        reset_pin: 26
        model: 4.20in
        lambda: |-
          if (id(openweathermap_condition).has_state()) {
            it.printf(5, 160, id(font20), ""Condition: %s"", id(openweathermap_condition).c_str());
          }

And when I go to compile it I get this:

    src/main.cpp: In lambda function:
    src/main.cpp:509:78: error: 'class esphome::homeassistant::HomeassistantSensor' has no member named 'c_str'
             it.printf(5, 180, font20, ""Condition: %s"", openweathermap_condition-&gt;c_str());

Some help needed for new RPi 4 + SSD setup,"I'm using HA for over a month now (RPi 3 + sd card) and its working nicely. Before christmas I'm planning to upgrade my setup for more long term usage. I want to follow the advice from this sub and switch to an ssd setup.

My current planned components:

* Raspberry Pi 4 8GB
* official power supply
* ELUTENG USB 3.0 to SATA adapter (I read that this one is the most reliable currently?)
* Crucial BX500 240GB SSD

I'm still not sure which case I should use for the RPi 4. Any recommendations? Not sure if active or passive cooling is needed and there are a lot of different cases available.

Also do I need some case for the SSD or do I just connect it via the dapter, put it next to the RPi 4 and call it a day?

Flashing Home Assistant to Dell Wyse 7020,"I'm in a bit of a situation.  I purchased a Wyse 7020 to install HA on a 256 ssd.  I upgraded the ram from 4 to 8 and removed the 16gb flash ssd and installed a 256 ssd.  I did the recommended install by using the Ubuntu route.  By temporarily using Ubuntu and plugging in another USB with NUC image to install.

Everything to this point is fine, but when I get to the step to install the image in terminal.  Terminal briefly pauses and gives results of an install.  That's it!  Is there another step?  When I go off the guidelines and power off remove usb drives and it reads "" home assistant will install"".  But after the restart the Wyse loops. 

How can I get this to successfully load HA?  Did I miss a step?   FYI, The installed ssd has the nuc image unloaded on it.

HA notification target for desktop Linux?,"I'm looking for a way to get HA notifications on my Ubuntu desktop.  I'd like define a notification target in HA and send the notifications that way.  My desktop is a different system on the same network.  I'm not looking for HTML5 notifications or anything that depends on a web browser being open on my desktop.


On the desktop side, what I had in mind would be akin to other generic notifications, like where NetworkManager sends its notifications.  For example, when I connect to a network, a notification bubble pops up at the top right of my desktop saying ""Successfully connected to X"".  I want HA notifications to produce desktop notifications like that.


Looking at https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#notifications , nothing jumped out at me, although I'm unfamiliar with most of the technologies and services listed there.  Growl ( https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/gntp/ ) looks like maybe a good fit?  On my desktop, I'd need to setup a GNTP server and somehow integrate that with the notification indicator.  I'm just spitballing - I don't know off the top of my head how to accomplish it.


In principle I understand that it'd probably be trivial to setup a websocket listener and listen for all events, filter on the client, and produce notifications that way.  I'd be interested to know if anyone's doing that, but that's not ideally what I'm looking for.


Are there any easy wins that are available to me?


edit: bonus points if the solution doesn't depend on 3rd party services etc.  I'm looking for a single LAN connection.  I'd even consider doing something with SMTP but that seems a bit heavy-handed for what I want to accomplish, since it'd require both a mail server and client.

Question about trying OpenZwave(beta) as a second parallel zwave instance,"So, I've searched....and I can't seem to find an answer.  I'm sure I've missed it somewhere.

I have HA installed on an Ubuntu server in my basement (unsupported, I know) and have been using a remotely located RPi with a Nortek HUSBZB-1 as my zwave/zigbee ""hub"" via a USB over IP service.  I use HA's native Zwave and Zigbee integrations, and for the most part, everything works fine......aside from the service not restarting automatically on the Pi after a power outage.

I've been wanting to try out the OpenZwave integration instead, but I've got a LOT of zwave devices on my network, and I'm not interested in moving everything over right away.  I have a second HUSBZB-1 and was wondering if I can plug that into another Pi, install the OpenZwave integration in HA, and have both sticks working at the same time.

Anyone else have issues with their theme's background image after a recent HA update?,"I have a few themes installed currently. Ever since an update recently (I want to say it was .116 but could be off), the background image for all the themes don't work.

What additional platform for more advanced control?,"OK, so I'm looking for a platform that will allow me to do more advanced automations more easily.

When the door is closed, return the light to its last state.

***What platform(s) would you recommend for more advanced decision-making like this?***

I could pretty much code this all out easily in C++:

1. Rescale 6:30AM-Sunset to 0-1
2. Use the 0-1 value to interpolate between 2 or more colors throughout the day
3. Each minute: All lights color = circadian color
4. Each light has a struct that contains the current color, brightness, and override bit
5. Each light also has a copy of the struct that contains a backup value.

For themes:

1. If I request a theme, it sets the override bit to ignore the circadian schedule.
2. Reset the bit when requesting restored lighting and retrigger circadian lighting
3. Each morning, the circadian bit is reset

For the doors:

1. When a door is opened, current state -&gt; backup state
2. override = true. color = red
3. When door is closed again, backup state -&gt; current state

Easy peasy, and I would be able to perform this as an array that is auto-generated from the complete list of lights.

But just *imagine* trying to do this in YAML. Absolutely unusable for advanced decision-making.

The closest I can think of is node-red. But even node-red has trouble thinking about things like data flow, arrays, global variables, etc. It seems to prefer events and hard-coded values. For instance, I can't even recall ""sunset time"", because the sunrise component only seems to return trigger events AT sunrise and sundown, rather than giving me the actual numbers at any time. Certainly doable, but it seems like most of these GUI solutions add more complexity than they resolve.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 04:10:48,What additional platform for more advanced control?,"OK, so I'm looking for a platform that will allow me to do more advanced automations more easily.

"Anyone have experience with linking ""Ecovacs Robot Vacuum OZMO920"" (or similar) to HA?","The wife has been encouraging me to get a robo vacuum, which is great, but one of my deal-breakers is that it connects well with HA. One of hers is apparently that it mops as well as vacuums.

MQTT JSON with special caracters ?,"Hello guys,

I'm requesting some help: I'm completly stuck on that ! I'm going crazy

I have this MQTT payload coming from a device that monitors my solar panel.

My goal is to get the temperature from DS18B20-1 sensor.

I tried example from the MQTT doc but without success.

I've done some experimenting in template editor with that :

`{% set value_json = {""Time"":""2020-11-22T12:24:47"",""DS18B20-1"":{""Id"":""05178020D8FF"",""Temperature"":61.1},""DS18B20-2"":{""Id"":""0517806665FF"",""Temperature"":38.7},""Temperature_Solar"":39,""Temperature_Tank"":34,""Current_Pump"":0,""Current_Heater"":0,""TempUnit"":""C""}`

`%}`

`{{ value_json.DS18B20-1.Temperature }}` 

&amp;#x200B;

The output is:

 `UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'DS18B20'` 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that the dash in the name ""DS18B20**-**1"" is not recognised correctly and split the name!

&amp;#x200B;

For moment, here's my configuration.yaml, that obviously not working  :

  `- platform: mqtt`

`name: ""Tank up temperature""`

`device_class: temperature`

`state_topic: ""tele/cel/sol/SENSOR""`

`unit_of_measurement: '°C'`

`value_template: ""{{ value_json.TEmperature }}""`

HA loses connection with Homematic IP blinds,"Hey, 

for some reason, every blind actuator I use always loses connection with the Homematic hub and therefore isn't available in Home Assistant.

Due to this, I cannot use them in solo in Home Assistant, which I would like to do. Anybody have any idea what's going on?

Amcrest AD110 Doorbell - any idea on when we will get more integration?,"Does anyone have any word/rumors about when we will get more Amcrest integration? 

I can use motion detect to trigger flows in NR - but if I try and take a snapshot with the doorbell camera - it does nothing. Almost seems like when motion detection is trigger inside the camera that locks up the RTSP for a few seconds (things become ""unavailable"". 

Clear -&gt; Detected -&gt; Unavailable -&gt; Clear

Sort of weird. I also tried https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-amcrest-ad110 and didn't get very far. The snapshot node didnt work for me and the monitor node throws a lot of HTTP 400 errors (I tried ""Use RAW codes""). Shame this pallete doesn't have documentation and it seems like only a few dozen people have tried it out.

Couple this lack of integration with the fact that brightness won't shift if a person is in a shadow and approaching the door (and lack of brightness control in general) and that you can't disable motion detection alerts without disabling the ""alert me if someone presses the doorbell"" - and I really think I may need to find a new product But, again, with better HA integration I can get past all of this. I would love to use HA to manage the 2-way intercom instead of the app. I would love to get it working better with Facebox so that photos are stored when someone the system doesn't recognize approaches, etc.

Newbie question about hardware to start with,"I've been thinking about starting with Home Assistant for a while and I'm now ready to take the plunge. I realize Raspberry Pi seems to be the common starting point for base hardware but I also see people talking about later upgrading because the Pi no longer meets their needs.

What components are most important for those upgrading from a Pi? I have an older mini PC that was previously used as a media server so I'm trying to decide whether I get started on that or on a Raspberry Pi. The Pi would be preferred since it's much smaller and more energy efficient.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-21 18:07:20,Newbie question about hardware to start with,"I've been thinking about starting with Home Assistant for a while and I'm now ready to take the plunge.

Home Assistant freezing my PC,"Hey everyone,

I'm a bit stuck, it seems my home assistant has managed to start messing up overnight. I launch it via the virtual machine on my PC, normally via the vm service in the background and today It's started freezing my computer to making it almost entirely non responsive as soon as it reaches the ""started"" phase. I've made no changes overnight to cause this. I installed the new HA earlier in the week &amp; reset and reinstalled my ring doorbell into its app yesterday but neither resulted in errors at least not that i noticed.

So far I've tried:- Updating the oracle virtual machine to its latest version

\- Updating the extensions pack to its latest version

\- Increasing the amount of ram the virtual machine has access to

\- Removing the animated wallpaper from my home assistant

\- Removing the ring integration from the home assistant.

I have a i7 6700K and 32gb of ram on my pc so this shouldn't be an issue. It was working fine previously

Anyone have any ideas?

Sensor Integration for Owlet Smart Sock v2/v3 ( Using Modern Owlet API ),"Hey folks,   


I recently got an Owlet Smart Sock for my son, and was annoyed by the fact that I couldn't view the statistics from anywhere other than a mobile phone app. Particularly, I wanted to be able to graph them so I could see trends and whatnot, because that's just who I am. Anyhow, I made a custom HA integration to allow me to collect the data via HA + scrape with Prometheus + graph in Grafana, and figured I'd share.   


[https://github.com/jlamendo/ha-sensor.owlet](https://github.com/jlamendo/ha-sensor.owlet)  


Grafana Graphs:   


[I don't have these uploaded anywhere at the moment, but I'll be glad to do so if requested.](https://preview.redd.it/dspcog0naj061.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=934128193d790249dd34c47a0fb5b55dd1723050)

It's not perfect by any means - there have been a few times when it's locked up, and I'm not sure if it's my fault or Owlet's. The default scan interval is set to 10s, please don't set it any faster - I don't want to abuse their undocumented API and have access revoked for all of us. As a bonus, though, having the data gathered this way does allow you to track and graph things like movement as a % rather than just the boolean ""%s is wiggling"" that the app gives you.  


I would have liked to submit it for inclusion as an actual integration, but there are two issues with that:  
\#1. Integrations have to have API libraries as separate Python libraries. I could do this with relatively low effort, but alas, I have a 1-month-old baby and don't really have the time to spare.  
\#2. It's setup to only be configurable via YAML. Personally, I prefer this, but the new HA guidelines state that all new integrations must be configured via the GUI, in order to make it more friendly towards less technical users.   


If anybody wants to take a shot at resolving those issues so it can be used by more people, PR's are welcome. Otherwise, instructions for installation are in the README, and if you reach out to me I'll be glad to provide what little support I can with the kinds of spare time a new parent has :D   


A side note on #2 - I've been in software development professionally for 7 years now, and I'll be honest, I've never seen an API that was so confusing, difficult to use, and poorly documented as the GUI config setup. I'm sure it's not a problem for old hat HA devs or those who specialize in Python, but in an attempt to make things more friendly to less-technically inclined users, it has made things much less friendly to new integration developers. And the end result there is that if you want to use this and belong in that ""less technical"" camp, it's probably going to be a bit of a pain to install if you haven't installed a custom component yet.

My experience moving from a Pi4 install to a NUC.,"It was incredibly straightforward and mostly issue-free. I downloaded the NUC image from the HomeAssistant site, plugged the MSata drive from my NUC into a USB MSATA adapter (£10 from Amazon) and flashed, the first flash didn’t seem to work but extracting the image file first and flashing with that did the trick - that might have been some random issue on my end because it makes no sense at all.

HA booted with HDMI output and appeared on my network as Homeassistant, I installed the Samba addon, deleted the default config directory and copied my config directory directly over the network while HA was running  and reinstalled my other Addons - MQTT Broker, File Editor etc. Plugged in my RFlink box via USB and everything just worked - I obviously needed to point my Tasmota devices to the new NUC HA IP.

This is just a reassurance to anyone mulling over such a move that it’s straightforward.

"Will ""delay"" be interrupted?","Hey. For dummies, please. If you use delay in an automation, will another automation interrupt (and stop) that delay? I'm asking this because I made an automation that had a 30 minute delay before carrying out an action and I see that action was never carried out. All I can think of is that actually during that delay there was another automation that carried out an action. Could that be the cause of the delay apparently stopping and never carrying out the following action?

Could this have to do with the modes (single, restart, etc.)? Or is that not relevant because in this case we're talking about an action from a different automation?

Trying to understand Zigbee/Zwave offline control,"Hi Reddit,  


Long time lurker first time poster. I'm a complete NoOb to HA but I;m ready to jump in the deepend after a number of VERY frustrating experiences over the past couple of months with a Smart home built entirely around the SmartThings ecosystem.   


So now that I've made the decision I figure its go BIG or go home. So if I'm going to put in the effort to setup my HA I would like to control my whole house completely offline. So my biggest question here is if I currently rely on my ST hub to be the brain of my Zigbee/Zwave smart home, and the ST hub relies on being online to control devices how then can I set up a new HA install that controls all my devices without the need for internet connection?   


I will look to run HA on an old (always on) Intel NUC Mini PC that I've had lying around so that this is a dedicated machine for this purpose and this purpose only. So my question is should I be looking to attach a USB Zigbee/Zwave stick to this machine or am I over complicating things and should just use my existing hub. I also have a UPS (uninterupted power supply) that I intend to plug this into so that it hopefully never goes down regardless of if the power goes out or internet isn't working. I'm also hoping this will allow faster return to normal when all other smart devices come back up after a power outage (no need to wait for PC/HA to reboot).   


I'd love some input from anyone currently running HA on a PC and anything you ""wish someone had told you"" as a noob. As well as any recomendations on best USB Zigbee/ZWave sticks if thats a recomendation that someone more learned than myself is willing to offer.

Home Assistant fans - what is the best way you've found to secure your devices?,"Hey everyone! Looking to get an open discussion going on the easiest/most-secure way each of you secure your devices.

For context, I initially started securing my Tuya-based devices by taking them off my personal 2GHz WLAN and moving each device to a 'Guest' network. I then realized I should probably change all of the passwords entered into each device into something that isn't a password I use on other platforms (stupid past me). Ultimately, I've realized that perhaps the best way to 'secure' these devices is to take all of these individual lightbulbs, sensors, and apps offline, a la Home Assistant.

For starters, I tried localizing my devices by going the Tasmota route on one of my door sensors - and wasn't successful (probably bricked it lol). Even though I have a lot of experience with a soldering iron, the prospect of popping open every lightbulb and sensor I have in my apartment to flash them via serial wasn't very appealing.

I did see that some devices come with Tasmota preloaded on them, but has anyone here had success with those? Do they have the same out-of-the-box functionality as other purchasable devices, or do they feel like 'hacked' devices? I have minimal experience with Tasmota, so really not sure what to expect, and honestly its not appealing to replace every device in my home either :)

I can't help but think there must be other methods others use, which brings me to this discussion! 

So: What are some of your go-to ways to secure your devices? Do you even secure them at all, do you simply use a guest WiFi to connect, or do you flash Tasmota via hard-wiring? Very curious to hear what the best methods are :)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-20 17:14:01,Home Assistant fans - what is the best way you've found to secure your devices?,"Hey everyone!

Load Cells vs Thin Film Pressure Sensor for bed occupancy?,"I (perhaps somewhat over ambitiously) ordered a pack of load cells and amplifier after reading a few articles about using them as a bed presence sensor.  Really like the idea of enabling under bed lighting when I'm coming home late and my gf is asleep.

But I also saw, yesterday (the day the load cells came in) people using thin film pressure sensors, under the mattress.  This brings up a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

Pros and Cons of the two?

Can I put the load cells under the mattress?  I have an expensive vintage Broyhill headboard, I don't really like the idea of having 3D Printed holders and wires stretching visibly under the bed.

"I want to make my dumb dehumidifier smart, how to emulate a button press?","Hey all, I have several devices which I want to smarten up but unfortunately they don't automatically turn on when plugged in so I can't use a smart plug. They require a button press to turn on and I was wondering if anyone here has converted a dumb device into a smart one. The two devices I have in mind at the moment is my electric blanket and dehumidifier. I want to have a sensor tell home assistant that it's too humid and have home assistant automatically turn on my dehumidifier for 2 hours.

I know there exists ready made button pressers but I want a project and to do this cheaply. If I expose the circuit board and find the momentary switch which turns the device on, what are my options to emulate a button press, or the convert it into a toggle switch?

The guy at ""the hook up"" used a optocoupler with a wemos d1 mini to make make a pool controller and I was wondering if that would work for a dehumidifier and if that's best practice. Would a relay be better? Solenoid? Any other ideas?

Super Excited to have gotten Windows HotKeys to perform Home Assistant automations,"So I wanted to use my keyboard to trigger lighting scenes in home assistant, so I went looking for a solution (man do I love the forums and all the amazing work so many have done and shared). It was actually pretty simple to set up hotkeys that publish to MQTT/mosquitto. The last part is of course writing automations that are triggered by that MQTT topic.  I also stored the HotKey definition file in a dropbox folder so that it's easy to keep any PC's with this function enable with all of the same customizations.

My original Idea was to have holding the Home key + the #1 on my keyboard set ""Scene 1"" and maybe Home+0 puts the house into the Goodnight Scene.  But as I got started, I kept thinking of new ones to make - curious what everyone else can come up with.  My goal was to make the shortcut itself intuitive enough that I have very little to keep memorized in my head.  At this point I've got

Home+1 = Lighting Scene X

Home+G+1 = Open or close Garage Door 1 (I can safely see my garage from my desk chair, Garage doors can be very dangerous to put into automations - for this reason, I may not actually use this idea)

Home+M = Mute any/all playing Sonos zones in the house

Home+Esc = Mute all Sonos zones, Pause Smart TV, Mute Desktop Amp, Turn on all house lights

Person location is not updating. Always shows Home.,"New HA user, got everything setup but the home / away feature does not seem to work with me or my wife . The details

- both using Pixel phones (4a and 5)
- both registered app, all sensors enabled, location is on background all the time
- linked device.tracker.pixel to each person
- I can see most the other sensors work, eg charging and notifications. They change in HA in real time and the history is accurate
- geocoded location and a few other items  never change though. Just always show as our house, even in the history when I know we have been away and I've opened the HA app

About flash memory,"Hi,

I never had problems with sd cards, but now that i'm done experimenting with HA, I'm thinking about replacing my HA sd card with an ssd.

I can no longer reach the the HA interface by any means,"HA installed on a Pi4 (migrated from a Pi3B+)

All was well, until a short while after I upgraded to the Pi4. Fresh install of HA on a new SD card, and then restored settings from a backup of the 3B+ system. It worked perfectly for a few days, then it became completely unresponsive – the system turns on, appears to boot (from the LED activity), and even shows up on my router as 'homeassistant' (ethernet into a switch).

However any attempt to access by either app or webportal fails, and none of its automations are occurring. I cannot shell into it. I bought a damn micro HDMI adapter and plugged in a screen and keyboard... nothing.

So I got clean SD card, flashed with the most recent HA build, with the intent of again restoring from the backup I still have from the 3B+.

"MQTT, ESP8266 and WiFi Denial of Service Issues","I am suffering from a random combination of issues and i am struggling to find out the cause. Apologies for the long(ish) post so bare with me.

My set up is that i have a number of sensors set up with Wemos D1 Mini pushing updates to an MQTT Server (mosquito) running on my Pi 4 with SSD also running Home Assistant. The D1 Mini are all connected over wifi to my 2.4GHz band on my ASUS RT-AC66U router. Home Assistant and the Pi are connected directly to the router over a fixed link.

Over the past few weeks my 2.4GHz would completely die and all devices connected would fail, I ordered a replacement router connected it all up set my SSIDs the same, my devices would reconnect and a few mins later the 2.4GHz band would fail again... this was an odd coincidence, the new router was a Netgear R7000.

Eventually after resetting a number of devices i got the network back up and it was stable again for a week, until the issue happened again.

I have slowly increased the number of D1 Mini devices (currently only 4) over lockdown and my wifi issues have gotten progressively worse.

Checking some of the device logs it seems to be occasionally losing connectivity to the mosquito broker on the Pi and then finally it would lose connection to the wifi. When i removed one of the devices (a motion sensor) the wifi came back up within minutes, which again was odd coincidence, could the Wemos minis be causing a denial of service on the wifi they are meant to be connecting to?

I have done my absolute best to optimise the code and to only push MQTT updates when there is a status change, or on devices where that doesnt happen frequently i have added delays to the loops so it updates every few seconds.

I had never suffered a local wifi issue prior to September when i first began to create my own IoT devices and sensors but i don't understand how these devices could be taking down my own wifi. The 5GHz remains perfectly stable without issue (none of the Wemos are connected to that band as they only have 2.4GHz antennas).

I have since removed all devices off the network and i am going to slowly introduce them back to see if i can correlate the events better. Perhaps the MQTT server is getting too many messages, but my Pi is connected directly to the router and isn't using Wifi. Or it could just be the devices are hitting the router hard with requests and crashing the 2.4GHz band. The fact a totally different router from Netgear has the same issue makes me think that a device is causing it.

So my question to the community... has anyone had any wifi issues when using Wemos sensors over MQTT? Is there an alternative method i could send and receive updates from devices rather than MQTT? Or is there a maximum number of devices or messages that i should try and limit sending?

Totally confused with this.

Delay/Unresponsive behaviour when moving between views,"Hi there,

I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing a delay/lag, unresponsive behaviour when moving between different views in their HA? I can see the URL change but the page does not or click on elements simply does nothing.

For weeks I've been trying to pin down the culprit by removing certain components, elements from views, clearing browser cache etc.

I've checked in both HA logs (tail -f home-assistant.log) and watching either Chrome or Firefox inspector tab to see what is causing the delay but I can't seem to figure it out! 

I've increase the RAM for the VM to 5GB and given it an extra core but still getting the same result?! 

The only thing I can think of it maybe due to the amount of 'custom' cards I have on each view? I must admit I am a big fan of the 'custom:button-card' and use it on every page to organise and create the layout I want.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-20 22:32:24,Delay/Unresponsive behaviour when moving between views,"Hi there,  I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing a delay/lag, unresponsive behaviour when moving between different views in their HA?

Coming from SmartThings (via Wink),"I'm moving into a new house next month and am leaving my old IoT devices and SmartThings hub with the new owners of my current home. I really like the layouts that I've been seeing here with HA, Tileboard, Magic Mirror, etc so I am planning on building out the new environment based on HA.

First question: Will a mini with a Intel N3450 be powerful enough for the HA server? I expect to use the GoControl HUSBZB-1 radio with it. Any issues here?

Second question: I haven't dug too far into the cool layout/displays. I see that HA does serve up a WebUI. I plan on having at least two (up to 4) different screen locations.  The screen size will vary widely so I don't want them all to present the same content.  Does HA allow for different endpoints to have separate rendering agents or is all of that done at the server and presented in the WebUI the same at each endpoint? I hope the question is clear.

Change color coding for led stripes over zha,"I just got two really nice led zigbee light stripes that I wanted to put around my living room. I than figured out I just need one zigbee receiver to do what I wanted to do and have one left to make one stripe smart, that currently isn't.

Open Z-Wave,"I just started to use homeassistant a month ago. Moving off smartthings. 

Had some issues getting z-wave setup but was pretty close. Had about 7 devices connected but then it all fell apart. Shelved it and came back to start from scratch with a new Z-stick. 

The normal z-wave addon that I used last time is not there any more. My only option is open z-wave beta. Is this what we have to use now? Haven't had much luck at all with it. I have an Aotec Gen5 plugged into my PC with VirtualBox setup. I've got it to recognize it.  I haven't got anything else to pair yet. I've tried both just using the ""Add node"" in configuration as well as taking the stick out. 

I end up seeing nodes with an ID and it just has the Query Stage as ""Probe"" and it never progresses from there. Am I doing something wrong?

I installed MQTT broker but haven't done anything with it. Is there something else to do here? The documentation mentioned omzdaemon installed and running in your network, was confused on this. Do I need to install that on my vm? Not super familiar with vmware of dockers.

DS18B20 Probe,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

Bought a Sonoff TH16 &amp; DS18B20 to help me monitor my garage freezer.  Last winter the garage got so cold the freezer stopped cooling for awhile so I just want to be able to monitor it closer.

So I got everything hooked up and connected to HA, my real question is in regards  to the probe placement.  Can it just dangle or does it need some type of thermal buffer for an accurate reading?  It's currently dangling off the wall towards the side and the temp is reading higher then I would expect.  The probe wire is also currently just putting between the door, so I know I should probably drill a hole to run the probe.

control ralais over MQTT and homeassistant,"Hey there.

My plan is to automate my home with a raspberry PI as a central server. The PI should control everything (homeassistant). This happens over mqtt ( Smart plugs ...) and over relais ( with the gpios of the pi). Is there a possibility to teach the alexa/googleThing(dont know the name) that when I say e.g. ""Switch the leight off"" that the alexa/googlewhatever forwards the message to the broker? So basically the alexa/googlesmartstuffthingy works only as the voice interface.  
Has anyone a idea how to integrate the railais via the mqtt broker correctly, or do i have to code it on my own?   
The plan would be here that I have some kind of pythonscript that works as an mqtt client ( which is connected to the local mashine). Like the alexa tells the homeassistant ""light off"" the homeassitant sends it to the locally installed broker and the broker forwards it to the also locally running python script, which activates the ralais. It this the way to go or can i go more efficent?

Checking the SleepyQ github page, there was previously a workaround used by the Hubitat folks (specifying a user agent string) but that doesn't do more than get past the login issue.  Subsequent API calls fail with a 403.

Doing a bit of research, the Homebridge SleepIQ plugin had a comment posted five days ago saying that the author received a request from the SleepIQ folks to take his plugin down.  Apparently, API requests were swamping their portal and impacting their ""legitimate"" user base.

Are there ANY good Z-wave motion sensors??,"I'll start with context. I already have an [ecolink PIR motion sensor](https://www.zwaveproducts.com/products/z-wave-plus-easy-install-with-pet-immunity-motion-detector-white) and love it. Battery life is awesome, even with me triggering it all day long, but it's a bit ugly, bulky, and doesn't have a pivot mount which is what I prefer in some locations. I also have 2 [Aeotec Trisensors](https://aeotec.com/z-wave-motion-sensor/), which I am happy that have motion, temperature and light sensors.....but I've completely given up on them. Batteries are only lasting 3-4 days before they are dead. I've looked at firmware updates, config changes, location changes...nothing seems to work so I am ready to move on from those....but I much prefer their appearance to that of the ecolink. Also for their price point, I would have expected much better performance which make me think trying their multisensor 6 would also be a waste of time and money.

At this point I think I've seen almost ever other motion sensor on the market and most seem to have some other drawback, like requiring a special hub (aqara) or have led indicator lights that can't be turned off (Zooz?). I am using a smartthings hub at present and right now at least, would rather not go down the usb dongle route for the time being. 

Am open to new ideas where people are finding success with their motion sensors. Critical to me would be multi-month batt life, responsitivity, an pref smartthings compatibility.

If all else fails, I may just get more ecolinks and attach the pivot mounts from the Trisensors to the ecolinks. Still, all the products I see available today are a few years old, disappointed that I don't see any more new sensors out there.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-19 19:27:15,Are there ANY good Z-wave motion sensors??,"I'll start with context.

How I made the cheapest home cctv system with Wyze Cams and HLS,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wxiiiwyuk4061.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dea2827df40213e9bb6dbd1bc5683508053c3ae

Hello there. I would like to share my experience with making the cheapest home cctv system.

I'm a fan of WyzeCams and was trying to fit it into my smart home system for a while.

It's super cheap and specs are pretty good, but the only flaw is not stable RTSP firmware.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a solution that allows you to convert mp4 files from NFS to HLS stream.

That HLS stream could be fed to any modern video surveillance system.

Here is the URL to my repo: [https://github.com/n1ckyrush/wyzecam-hls](https://github.com/n1ckyrush/wyzecam-hls)

It's pretty simple nodejs script with ffmpeg.

It's based on NFS hack (props to the original author!), you will find all instructions inside my repo.

&amp;#x200B;

After many months of fighting with RTSP and Wyze now it works flawlessly.

Hopefully it will make somebody life easier ✊

Feel free to shoot me any questions.

P.S. If you are interested in my whole journey with it, I made a long post about it: [https://n1ckyrush.com/en/blog/3-how-to-make-wyzecam-stream-stable-hls-instead-of-rtsp](https://n1ckyrush.com/en/blog/3-how-to-make-wyzecam-stream-stable-hls-instead-of-rtsp)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-19 04:14:29,How I made the cheapest home cctv system with Wyze Cams and HLS,"​     Hello there.

Trouble with the Android Companion App,"I have one device I'm having problems with logging into Home Assistant on, and I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.

I have three android devices, all with the 3.0.0-minimal version of the app installed from F-Droid. None of them are ordinary devices, but two of them are working while one isn't, and I'm trying to figure that one out.

1. Pixel 3 with GrapheneOS (no Google Play Services) connected to an always-on VPN. Working fine connected to my Home Assistant over a reverse proxy with DuckDNS.
2. Galaxy S7 that's been majorly debloated and Google Play Services blocked using Netguard. No VPN here. Working fine connected directly to Home Assistant using local IP and port.
3. Galaxy Tab S3, rooted with Google Play Services removed, connected to the same always-on VPN. This one isn't working.

The weird thing is, I can connect to Home Assistant using the reverse proxy on the Galaxy Tab. Both in the app and in a browser, I can connect to the server and log in, but about 10 seconds after logging in, something happens and it just says ""Unable to connect to Home Assistant"".

I don't want to report this as a bug until I know it's not something wrong with my configuration, but I'm struggling to diagnose this problem, because nothing is showing up in the logs about the attempted access.

Any ideas?

Edit: I think I have the source of the problem narrowed down.

Need some help flashing Tasmota to a new MagicHome RGB LED controller,"I got Tasmota working on some older MagicHome controllers, but I've since ordered a new batch of them and can't seem to get the flash to work.

Non-Cloud Thermostats,"I'm looking for a ""smart"" thermostat that doesn't require an internet connection to work. Bonus points if it looks kinds of nice.  I've got a fairly strong Z-Wave Plus network and ZigBee throughout my place.

How to monitor electrical usage of an outlet,"I just built a shed and have a through the wall ac/heater. I want to know how much it runs trying to keep the shed warm. I don't specifically need power consumed but won't avoid it, I just want cycle times.

But first I just want to see when it is pulling power and if easy enough, how much power that will work with home assistant.

I don't have any home automation set up currently but really liking how far it has come over the last several years and want to start fairly simple.

I also hate cloud and fully intend to go self hosted. I know there are a lot of devices that require using a specific app for setup. I also know there are ways to flash devices to fix that.

"Friendly Reminder - Don't use a SD card, on a PI install!","[https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/search?q=sd%20card&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/search?q=sd%20card&amp;restrict_sr=1)

I see at least a handful of threads popup every, single, week regarding ""reliability"" issues on Home Assistant.

Overall, home assistant, is actually a very reliable services to run. Nearly every single reliability issues have ONE THING in common.

They are all using a Raspberry PI, and utilizing the SD card for home assistant.

(Note- the raspberry PI itself is perfectly reliable...)

If you do this, It WILL fail, UNLESS, you do one of a few things.

1. Greatly reduce what recorder / logbook stores.
   1. [https://community.home-assistant.io/t/solved-how-to-completely-disable-recorder-history-and-logbook/122483](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/solved-how-to-completely-disable-recorder-history-and-logbook/122483)
   2. The log/recorder by default, will save all of your state changes, causing a lot of I/O on your SD card. This will burn it out eventually.
2. Run an SSD.
   1. [https://www.savjee.be/2019/12/home-assistant-boot-pi-from-usb-ssd/](https://www.savjee.be/2019/12/home-assistant-boot-pi-from-usb-ssd/)
   2. [https://community.home-assistant.io/t/finally-raspberry-pi-4-boot-from-ssd-no-microsd-required/197826](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/finally-raspberry-pi-4-boot-from-ssd-no-microsd-required/197826)
   3. Plenty of other documented methods of doing this.
3. Record data to an external database, hosted elsewhere.
   1. [https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/)
   2. Just configure your recorder to utilize a database NOT hosted on your PI's sd card.
4. Map your recorder database to a ram-disk or /tmp folder. See r/pointdextre33 in the comments.
   1. If it's not writing to your SD card, its not wearing out your SD card.

You CAN buy a high quality SD card, AND disable your recorder, which will likely make your SD card live for a very, very long time.

However- if you want to keep your recorder and history, and you don't have the option of storing it on an external server.... your SD card will eventually fail.

Before somebody chimes in and says.. ""Well, I have never done any of that, and my samsung/sandisk/etc SD card has been going strong for 5 years"", You are an exception. Not the norm. go away.

My personal advice?

Just buy a 100$ optiplex.[https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?\_from=R40&amp;\_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;\_nkw=dell+optiplex&amp;\_sacat=0](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=dell+optiplex&amp;_sacat=0)

I know that HA can interact with Philips Hue products, but can it easily do a rule along the lines of:

   * revert those same bulbs to previous settings (maybe some were off, maybe some were on with a particular colour/brightness etc)

Gcode preview in HA feat. Klipper and Moonraker,"Since Octoprint is hardly the optimal UI in this day and age, I’ve  changed to using Moonraker and interfaces based on that. This means some  parts of my Home Assistant configuration had to change.

Here’s how I got the gcode preview from Klipper websocket service Moonraker to Home Assistant:

This executes the python script placed in the local folder  /etc/homeassistant/ which is specified as the config folder. It’s  accessible to the docker container.

    #configuration.yaml
    shell_command:
      gcode_preview_py: 'python /config/imgconvert.py {{ states.sensor.klipper_preview_path.attributes[""data""] }}'

Here’s the whole printer info code, and another sensor that extracts all  the metadata from print preview. Note this takes the full size image,  as my slicer generates a smaller thumbnail too. Be sure the json  attributes path matches your slicer – this should be good for slic3r  variants such as SuperSlicer.  Big thanks to Arksine for the example.

As for the camera entity, note the placeholder image placed in the www folder, in case there’s no sensor data to display yet. 

    #cameras.yaml

        {% endif %}
      scan_interval: 5
      content_type: image/png

 The python file for doing the conversion is very simple: 

    #imgconvert.py
    import sys, base64
    imgstring = sys.argv[1]
    imgdata = base64.b64decode(imgstring)
    filename = 'www/gcode.png'
    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(imgdata)

Finally, I made an automation that calls the shell\_command, this could probably be a bit more optimized:

What's the power consumption (idle wattage) of your HA setup?,"Many people run HA on Raspberry Pis, which we all know sip power. However, once people get into HA they often get sucked into running more services and look into getting something beefier.

"Room Assistant: My iPhone 12 does not get updated, my Apple Watch does","Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I just configured Room Assistant, to try out now with only one raspberry pi 3b+ (which contains home assistant + room assistant add-on). The second raspberry pi is currently being installed and configured.

I have some problems with tracking my iPhone 12. I use bluetoothLowEnergy for it in Room Assistant, and bluetoothClassic for my Watch. 

Now the thing is: the watch updates perfectly when i walk downstairs, but since it's bluetooth Classic, it updates quite slow. So i wan't to mainly track my iPhone 12, via BLE. It is visible in Home assistant via Room Assistant &gt; MQTT Broker &gt; MQTT integration, but it does not update. When i walk downstairs, it still says i'm upstairs, while the watch says ""not\_home"" (because i have no more trackers ofcourse).

Anyone who can help me? Here is my configuration:

Tuya Zigbee Connection Issues?,"I have multiple Zigbee devices and seem to have signal issues when the distance increases from the controller (CC2530 based), but one device in particular is giving me more issues.

I have one light switch that's giving me more problems than the others, it's a Tuya 3 button switch.  and often when I operate the switch all three LEDs flash, which I believe means it's reestablishing the Zigbee link, then it works fine.  The logs do show it is reconnecting.

I have another switch that is a similar distance from the controller although another room, this one works flawlessly.  The switch that does work (in the other room) is also a different model.

Backup-Server,"Hello. I have a very basic HA setup. An old microserver running FreeNAS and in a vm HA. Currently i use verry little features, lights with motion detection mostly. But non the less, if the server is down my wife is not happy, because she needs to switch the lights for the stairs on and of at the bottom (electrical installation was not optimal).

So i do want to have a backup plan. My best idea was to use a raspi with HA set up with exactly the same configs. Since i use git for that, that should not be the biggest problem. I would need to change the ip (or set both devices to the same ip) on my router. But i'm not sure about some metrics or autoconfig (meaning devices which are not in my configuration.yaml but show nontheless, like shelly devices or my smartphones). I'm not sure if i would loose these devices.  
Since the main is not running on a raspi, it's not as simple as just copying the sd card once in a while..

"[Tutorial] Using Deepstack, Blue Iris (or any cam s/w, and Node Red to do ML motion alerts","Hello everyone,  I made a [reply earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/juusah/whats_the_coolest_new_thing_youve_added_to_your/gchbnhg/) about some of the things I do in Home Assistant.  I got asked about them so I wanted to do a quick write up.

So the **goal of this** is to get more accurate motion detection using machine learning.  My camera has TONS of false motion alerts and I know a little bit about machine learning, so of course there must be a way to analyze images and see if they are true alerts right? RIGHT! 

First and foremost, if you haven't already I highly recommend this [video from The Hook Up](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2gyzKcHbYfqoXA5xbyGXtQ) I think the users reddit name is /u/DarkbunnySC


**Now I did a few things different.** 

1) I used the new deepstack CPU friendly image which is **deepquestai/deepstack:cpu-x5-beta** this has *significantly* reduced my CPU usage.    

2) I did not use the AI Tool in the video, I use node red (hence this write up).  And my node red flow will show why.  

3) I kept my Blue Iris Web UI security turned on (vs turning it off for local access in the video) but I by passed it for a specific IP.  To do this in Blue Iris I went to Settings --&gt; Web server --&gt; Advanced And in the Limit IP addresses I put a few IP addresses.  But the format needs to be as follows:

    ^10.0.0.1, ^10.0.0.2

This would bypass authentication for those specific IPs (for example). Blue Iris will let you do entire ranges but I only wanted to skip auth for specific devices.

---


So... for **node red**, 

[Here is an image of my flow.](https://imgur.com/a/Ryinhcs). 

[And here is the raw flow export](https://zerobin.net/?c215efddd4472ade#r0V/6nks7fThttCmpMVyyd+rINbpm18Ghg1BD4YMcu4=)

---

I use node red instead of the A.I. tool because it gives me WAY MORE functionality.  I think the tool is great, but everyone has their use cases.  



So my cameras are setup with 2 streams just like in the youtube video.  If I have a camera called let's say....garage, then I would have garagehd and garagesd.

This is important because I want to trigger the HD cameras to record only when Deepstack has determined the SD variant trigger is valid.  

---
To explain my node red flow think of it like this:


1) GARAGESD Camera is triggered --&gt; Blue iris stores images in a network folder on my server.

2) Node Red sees those images in that network folder and sends them to Deepstack via HTTP REQUEST node using the POST method.

3) Deepstack checks what the image is, and returns an object value (DOG, CAT, CAR) and a confidence level between 0.00 and 1 if applicable.

4) Node Red sees the OBJECT/CONFIDENCE and based on my criteria it passes through to trigger the HD stream of the camera, or it doesn't.

--- 

A couple of notes:

In the middle of my node red flow, I have a DAY/NIGHT node.  This is simply to lower the confidence threshold at night since it is harder to tell what is on an image at night.  At night my threshold is 50 and above and during the day it is 85 and above.  


The object filter node is where I determine what things I care about...CARS, DOGS, CATS, etc.  The full list is a comment at the bottom of the node when you double click it. Edit it to your liking  

Finally at the end of the node I have a rule that if 1 camera is triggered, it triggers another camera to record.  You can delete this or use it how you please.  I also keep a copy of all pictures that were valid movement with the File Move node at the very end.


The two pink nodes at the bottom with their green msg.label counter parts are for validation.  The pink nodes will show you what images are in the folder..literally show you on the flow itself.  The left image is what was detected, and the right image is what image made it through my threshold settings.  The green msg.label node will output text of WHAT was detect (car, cat etc) right under the node itself..so no need to check the debug column.

I am sure a lot of this can be refactored.  I would be curious to see what you all come up with!!

I got asked about them so I wanted to do a quick write up.  So the **goal of this** is to get more accurate motion detection using machine learning.  My camera has TONS of false motion alerts and I know a little bit about machine learning, so of course there must be a way to analyze images and see if they are true alerts right? RIGHT!   First and foremost, if you haven't already I highly recommend this [video from The Hook Up]  I think the users reddit name is /u/DarkbunnySC   **Now I did a few things different.**   1) I used the new deepstack CPU friendly image which is **deepquestai/deepstack:cpu-x5-beta** this has *significantly* reduced my CPU usage.      2) I did not use the AI Tool in the video, I use node red (hence this write up).  And my node red flow will show why.    3) I kept my Blue Iris Web UI security turned on (vs turning it off for local access in the video) but I by passed it for a specific IP.  To do this in Blue Iris I went to Settings --> Web server --> Advanced And in the Limit IP addresses I put a few IP addresses.  But the format needs to be as follows:      ^10.0.0.1, ^10.0.0.2  This would bypass authentication for those specific IPs (for example). Blue Iris will let you do entire ranges but I only wanted to skip auth for specific devices.  ---   So... for **node red**,   [Here is an image of my flow.] .   [And here is the raw flow export]   ---  I use node red instead of the A.I. tool because it gives me WAY MORE functionality.  I think the tool is great, but everyone has their use cases.      So my cameras are setup with 2 streams just like in the youtube video.  If I have a camera called let's say....garage, then I would have garagehd and garagesd.  This is important because I want to trigger the HD cameras to record only when Deepstack has determined the SD variant trigger is valid.    --- To explain my node red flow think of it like this:   1) GARAGESD Camera is triggered --> Blue iris stores images in a network folder on my server.  2) Node Red sees those images in that network folder and sends them to Deepstack via HTTP REQUEST node using the POST method.  3) Deepstack checks what the image is, and returns an object value (DOG, CAT, CAR) and a confidence level between 0.00 and 1 if applicable.  4) Node Red sees the OBJECT/CONFIDENCE and based on my criteria it passes through to trigger the HD stream of the camera, or it doesn't.  ---   A couple of notes:  In the middle of my node red flow, I have a DAY/NIGHT node.  This is simply to lower the confidence threshold at night since it is harder to tell what is on an image at night.  At night my threshold is 50 and above and during the day it is 85 and above.     The object filter node is where I determine what things I care about...CARS, DOGS, CATS, etc.  The full list is a comment at the bottom of the node when you double click it. Edit it to your liking    Finally at the end of the node I have a rule that if 1 camera is triggered, it triggers another camera to record.  You can delete this or use it how you please.  I also keep a copy of all pictures that were valid movement with the File Move node at the very end.   The two pink nodes at the bottom with their green msg.label counter parts are for validation.  The pink nodes will show you what images are in the folder..literally show you on the flow itself.  The left image is what was detected, and the right image is what image made it through my threshold settings.  The green msg.label node will output text of WHAT was detect (car, cat etc) right under the node itself..so no need to check the debug column.  I am sure a lot of this can be refactored.  I would be curious to see what you all come up with!!

Locate system,"I've built a AI system integration with Home assistant that, for example, alerts me when a package has arrived on my front door.  This system is ALL local and does not use any cloud services.  All processing is local and secure with none of your private information leaving your internal network.  

An alert can be sent by text, email, voice, or whatever automation techniques you currently use in your Home Assistant setup.

This  system, which I call **Locate,**  stands for **L**ocal **o**bject **c**lassification **a**nd de**t**ection **e**ngine, can be used for many other situtations.

1. Say you are away from home.  You may wish to be notified if a person is in your house, and possibly use home assistant automation to take some action.
2. Possibly you want to do something should a car enter your driveway.
3. Should a person be in your backyard between the hours of 10pm and 8am, notify you and do something.

It's all about easily using home assistant to automate the actions you chose when AI detects an object you anticipated.

Update Peanut Outlet Firmware OTA through HomeAssistant,"The Peanut Outlets always seem to ship with outdated firmware. With the outdated firmware, the outlets do not properly report power usage information always displaying as 0W. Updating firmware, in the past, required use of the Almond Hub or rather complicated procedures of updating Almond firmware on a 3rd party device.

I stumbled upon some discussion on GitHub ([https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/issues/522](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/issues/522)) regarding OTA firmware updates on ZHA devices through HomeAssistant and got it working for my outlets. I figured there may be others here who would like to update theirs without having to purchase more hardware to do so.

# Setup

First, a configuration change in HA is required to enable the OTA updates. Create a new directory on your system accessible by HA and then add the following to configuration.yaml. I don't use any IKEA or Ledvance deices so I explicitly disabled their auto updating.

    zha:
      zigpy_config:
        ota:
          ikea_provider: false
          ledvance_provider: false
          otau_directory: /path/to/your/ota/folder

Logging is useful for ZHA to ensure that it is working.

    logger:
      default: warn
      logs:
        homeassistant.components.zha: debug
        bellows.zigbee.application: debug
        bellows.ezsp: debug
        zigpy: debug
        zigpy_cc: debug
        zigpy_deconz.zigbee.application: debug
        zigpy_deconz.api: debug
        zigpy_xbee.zigbee.application: debug
        zigpy_xbee.api: debug
        zigpy_zigate: debug
        zigpy_znp: debug
        zhaquirks: debug

# Firmware File

Next, you need the newer firmware. I haven't found a direct link online, but someone posted the file on GitHub: [https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-OTA/raw/master/images/Tuya/ZPS\_CS5490\_039.ota](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-OTA/raw/master/images/Tuya/ZPS_CS5490_039.ota)

Place the .ota file in the directory you created earlier.

Restart HomeAssistant in order to activate the configuration changes.

# Updating Through HomeAssistant

The IEEE address of the plug is required in order to issue commands on the zigbee network. Find the device information in the ZHA integration.

Integrations -&gt; ZHA -&gt; Devices -&gt; (The Plug)

And reference the IEEE address of the plug under ""Device Info"" -&gt; ""Zigbee Info""

Next, access the HomeAssistant Developer Tools -&gt; Services tab.

Call the following service using the supplied values below in order to trigger the plug to request an OTA firmware update:

zha.set\_zigbee\_cluster\_attribute

    ieee: '&lt;The device IEEE&gt;'
    endpoint_id: 1 
    cluster_id: 5 
    attribute: 2 
    cluster_type: out
    value: 49502

And press the ""Call Service"" button.

Once invoked, the process will take a long time (i.e. 5-10 minutes). With debug logging enabled, the log will be flooded with transmission requests and confirmations during this time.

If you want to tail and grep the log, there is a percentage output:

    DEBUG (MainThread) [zigpy.zcl] [0x57cf:1:0x0019] OTA upgrade progress: 2.6

After the update completes, the device will have the wattage output properly reported in HomeAssistant. Additionally, the Device in ZHA seems to gain ""Firmware: 0x00000027"" in the ZHA integration. The stock firmware didn't list this at all.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-16 18:36:12,Update Peanut Outlet Firmware OTA through HomeAssistant,"The Peanut Outlets always seem to ship with outdated firmware.

I have a quick question about the Lutron Caseta dimmer switches,"I have HA running on a pi 3. I recently noticed that if I turn on a light using the wall switch, the light won't register in HA as being turned on. I have some automations that are triggered by the state of some of these lights, so these are broken.

I always had motion sensors and automations to turn my lights on and off and very rarely ever touched the switches, but I recently ended up getting a roommate and turned most of those automations off as to not freak him out, so I don't know if this is a new behaviour or if I'm just noticing it?

Reload Automations - Delay Actions &amp; Wait For Triggers," I'm using Delay and Wait For actions in many of my automations. Basic example, turn on driveway light at sunset, wait for time 23:59:59, turn off light.

I thought I was being clever in many of my automations by including delays and wait for triggers so that I could cut 2 automations into 1, but I'm finding as I tinker more and more - that the ""Reload Automations"" function necessary after making automation changes actually screws up many automations that are in the process of running with delays and wait for's.

Has anyone found a way around this? Or do I actually need to go back to having more than 1 automation that excludes the delay/wait for stuff?

With the example of the above, if a Reload Automation is called anytime between sunset and midnight, that light will not turn off at midnight. Do I need to go to 2 auto's here, 1 to turn off and 1 to turn on? Seems odd that the system can't retain the running automation.

"Two home assistant hubs, different locations","Has anyone come up with a good solution for having two HA set up in different locations and controlling them easily from the HA app?

I’m looking to have the ir transmission increase the number of repeats it does by the number of ir signals it receives in the last x seconds. so if I press the volume up once, it just increases the volume by 1, but if I hold the volume up button down the volume increases to ramp up (ie volume increases by 1 the first time, volume increases by 2 the second time, volume increases by 3 the third time)

has anyone does something similar or have any direction I could go in?",r/homeassistant,2020-11-16 09:32:33,[ESPHome] Scaling ir transmission repeats based on ir received,"Hi all,  Issue:   To control my amp using one remote, I configured my lg tv magic remote to transmit ir signals which I capture using esphome and transmit the correct ir signal to my amp.

"Show icon from entity state, use toggle from another ($10 to the winner)","I'm looking at making some sort of template button thing to make my setup work. I'm very new to this so I'm willing to PayPal $10 for the correct code.

I basically want a button showing the icon from cover.garage_door state (uses MyQ sensor to show up or down) but when I tap on the button I want it to toggle entity: switch.sonoff_1000439309.

The sonoff is a wifi relay used to open/shut the door.

Would a hub and door sensors work properly to send me a notification without clogging up the wifi?

Roborock E3 vs Eufy 30c Max,"Hi everyone! Please help me make up my mind. 

After doing some research on which robot vaccum to get I came down to these two options. I couldn't find a review that has tested both of them so all the information I got were from different websites. 

I think that Roborock E3 offers me the much needed mopping for an incredible accessible price compared to other robots and it is also silent (55db), the downside to this is that it is out of stock on Amazon (I live in the Netherlands) and no information when it would be back. I also can't seem to find it available to buy anywhere else.

Eufy 30c Max offers some good options for its low pricing and I have also heard a lot of people who enjoy theirs. From what I found it makes noise at around 68db, which is a bit louder than e3. It also has a great deal on it's official website running for two more days where I can get 100 euros discount and get it for 200 euros. I would also be getting it pretty soon as it is not sold out. Its stripe delimitation that comes with it are a great plus as well, but I would still go for the E3 on this price difference just for the mopping.

My questions are:
1. Should I wait for Roborock to get in stock or profit now of the 100 euro discount and get Eufy?  
2. What are your experiences with Roborock E3 / Eufy 30c Max?

Creative in/out of bed triggers for nighttime or morning automations?,"I'm curious what ways people have come up with to trigger automations just by going to bed or waking up. 

I think the simplest method would be to get a Withings sleep tracking pad and set up an IFTTT to trigger morning automations but IFTTT is limiting theses days and those pads aren't cheap!

I tried fooling around with my iPhone's sleep tracker to see if I could somehow connect that to IFTTT but it seems they can't access that particular information from your health app.

I've also heard of people triggering morning automations by unplugging their phones in the morning but I wouldn't know where to begin with that one.

Wallmounted tablet to control home? how? what?,"I want to have a tablet wall mounted to control the home, play music from, show youtube cooking videos etc. The google [nest hub](https://www.pricerunner.dk/product/1200x630/1871587345/Google-Nest-Hub.jpg) is a great solution, but it has a protruding speaker back that I don't want - I want it to mount flush against the wall.

It seems there was something called ""Ambient Mode"" last year, which was supposed to turn a regular tablet into a sort of nest hub - any experience with that?

Absolute best solution would be a smaller version of Samsung The Frame - something that looks like a small painting when off, but can come alive as a google remote station as well.

Thinking about leaving SmartThings. Sugestions?,"Like the title says, I'm thinking of switching away from the SmartThings system. Their recent announcement that they are shifting away from the hardware has me wondering how much longer the SmartThings cloud will last.

What other solutions besides HomeAssistant have I missed? With this mess with SmartThings,  I'm thinking I want a system that runs locally and doesn't depend on some random company's fortunes to continue working. 

I liked the look of OpenHab as it seemed as if it wasn't dependent on anything but a local computer and its ZigBee antenna, and seemed to be cheaper cost-wise. Hubitat on the other hand looked a bit like SmartThings but maybe slightly more local and cheaper in time investment.

My setup is currently a currently SmartThings hub running SmartThings sensors and Sengled devices with a few Sylvania bulbs tossed in for good measure, and a couple of WiFI plugs hooked into Alexa through Globe Suite.

Need Advice on Bathroom Light Occupancy sensor + Dimming ON A SCHEDULE,"I have a hall bathroom with no natural lighting. this is used by my young kids, who regularly leave the lights on.
To fix this, I've added a *Lutron Occupancy Sensor* to turn the lights on and off automatically, which works well. **The problem is that when the lights come on at night for a bathroom trip, it's too bright. If I dim the lights for nighttime use, it's too dark during the day**.

I'd like to figure out a way to keep the occupancy sensor working 24/7, plus dimming *on a schedule*. every solution I've come up with is missing something. Either I lose the bright lights at day, or the dim lights at night, or I lose the auto on/off functionality altogether. Or I have to have a second light or keep one powered on constantly.

I've briefly looked at smart lights like the HUE, which I know can do auto-dimming on a schedule, but I'm not sure they can work with the Lutron occupancy sensor if they lose power altogether when 'off'. Am I missing something?

Pellet stove control with a smart thermostat,"Currently I have a pellet stove, that uses a Nest thermostat for control. The Pellet stove has two modes for control with a thermostat.

Mode 1 “Pilot on”: in this mode the pellet stove always stays on. When the thermostat calls for heat it switches to a preset value (2-6 set manually on the side). When the thermostat doesn’t require heat it goes to the lowest setting (#1).

Mode 2 “Pilot Off”: Pellet stove runs in the same way as above except for after the thermostat hasn’t called for heat in 45 minutes the stove enters shut down mode. Takes about 10 minutes to fully shut down, and then waits for the thermostat to call for heat again before entering the startup (which again is another 10 minutes or so).

The issue: During fall and spring when the days are more than -5°C (23° F) the thermostat doesn’t require heat often enough to justify staying in the Pilot Off mode. So it cycles on and off often. But in the other mode the house can hit 30°C if not turned off manually.

My thoughts are maybe I can integrate something between the Nest and the heater that could demand heat for 5 minutes if the temperature is within a couple degrees of the set temperature. My a raspberry Pi (have one lying around that I use for game emulation about once a year)? Or maybe there is a better smart thermostat that could have an extra constraint put on it.

Thanks to anyone who might have an idea",r/homeautomation,2020-11-27 17:04:55,Pellet stove control with a smart thermostat,"Currently I have a pellet stove, that uses a Nest thermostat for control.

"Proxmox users, what do you use for NAS software? For backing up Android photos, etc.","I have a proxmox box with a spare large HD.  I was wondering what you folks use for NAS software?  Something like FreeNAS or OMV?  I was thinking of passing the HD directly to the ubuntu VM that would host the NAS (hoping it comes as a container).  

I currently use OMV (open media vault) on a separate Raspberry Pi.  I mostly just make the SMB available to a couple of Win10 machines and a Plex LXC container for media.  But SMB is kinda a pain to use - I'm not sure how to secure it but not have to type in password every time.  Is there a webapp based protocol kinda like OneDrive, but for your own server?  Maybe that comes with an app so Android devices can use it?

I'd also like to auto backup files between this new proxmox NAS and the Raspberry Pi OMV install, so the files exist on separate HD's on separate machines.  I'm not sure what to use for that.  Would it be rsync on OMV?  Or is something else better?

The point of an airgapped surveillance system,"Hi. 

I'm in the process of setting up a home surveillance system, using MotioneyeOS and raspberry pis. 

Because of security concerns I intend to use wired cameras and an airgapped server/storage. However, it dawns on me, that a potential intruder might, once he discovers that he is being taped, follow the wire to the central server and trash it. 
Further more, I'd like to get a notification in case an intrusion is detected. Maybe even have the possibility to check the cameras from my phone. However, I find that to be a major security concern, leaving an open port to my network and surveillance system.

I'm aware that I can't have it both ways. I guess I'm looking for input on how others have done it and general advice.

Help me make a steep ladder safer with motion detecting light!,"Hello!

I'm relatively new to home automation. I've got a Google Nest as well as a bunch of IKEA smart lights and a few Telluds WiFi smart sockets. Very basic stuff, but it gets the job done with controlling lights.

My apartment has a very steep ladder/stairway to a semi-floor. Like a small space above the kitchen where we have the beds etc. It's a rare and interesting design, but it makes more space in the apartment. Regardless, this ladder/stairway is extremely steep and ~2m tall, and I fear the day where my girl or I need to go down and pee and fall down the ladder in the darkness. So I'd like to install a motion detector that lights up the ladder, akin to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/c3z2k8/would_love_to_have_this/). I do not need it to be that fancy or have a delay between each step. I also don't need to drill or hide the cables, since it's more of a ladder than a stairway I can just tape the cables to the back of the ladder and it'll look nice enough.

So, what equipment do I need to be able to make this work? I want it to work both automatically through motion detectors (both on the bottom and top of the ladder) as well as through voice commands through Google Home.

I have extremely limited programming knowledge, took a course or two in C++ in high school many years ago, so I'd prefer something simple. 

I think it'd be cheapest to use those LED-strips that you can cut to length perhaps? Though I have some experience soldering, I've never understood exactly HOW they work, as I assume you need some driver for them as well?

If someone knows any decent and simple guides for this it'd be greatly appreciated!",r/homeautomation,2020-11-27 15:58:33,Help me make a steep ladder safer with motion detecting light!,"Hello!

Where do I aim my sights,"Hello!

Wife and I are closing on a house this December and are hoping to add i some home automation.

Currently we use google home as our assistant. We have a few Hue white bulbs that connect to our google home, and a first gen Sonos Play that connects to our google home.

Additionally we have a smart LG air conditioner that is connected to the google home and we have a smart capable asus Blue Cave router but I haven’t hooked that into the system.

Those are all the currently in use devices, I do also have two TPlink smart plugs not being used as well as a Wink 2 hub I got on clearance a year or so ago and haven’t used.

Looking forward we like google home as our assistant. Additionally we mainly would like to use smart light switches, plugs and maybe a doorbell in the future. I’m sure once we have our first child an indoor security camera will be coming.

I’m wondering which sort of hub will work best?

Should I stick with the wink 2? Is that going to limit my options? Or maybe switch to home assistant on the Raspberry Pi?

I’m pretty tech savvy and not afraid of some work but I’d rather not juggle more than one system.

If we have to retire some of the smart devices we have now it won’t be the end of the world.

Looking for any and all advise!

Trying to figure out which cameras and/or system to buy.,"I have the ring doorbell and love it. I want to add 2-4 cameras to my house for security and to see my dogs playing when they go out in the backyard. 

I have been looking for months and when I see something I like, I find a post saying it is terrible. Honestly, I am more lost after all of my research than I was before I started. 

I would like to be able to monitor the cameras from anywhere, want to have them show me live video as I click on the app, want to record data and want to be able to record at night. 

I have been saving up, so I can spend up a little for a system, but I feel lost on which one would actually meet my needs.

I would like to be able to monitor the cameras from anywhere, want to have them show me live video as I click on the app, want to record data and want to be able to record at night.   I have been saving up, so I can spend up a little for a system, but I feel lost on which one would actually meet my needs.   I have asked for a Google hub for Christmas that I will use as an alarm clock so it would be great to be able to look at the cameras using it (although not required).

Roborock S6 on bright/white flooring?,"Hello,

I  have a question regarding Roborock S6. ( I have tried to find people  with similar problem but didn't have much luck); I'm considering  purchasing S6 as it's really good value + does both mopping and  vaccuming, but in the description of the product it does say that it  might have trouble with really bright/white flooring. My house consists  mostly of hardwood and cream/white tiles (mostly matt), and I'm a bit  concerned if that's not going to create an issue and maybe I should go  for Braava M6. Therefore my question:

**Is Roborock S6 performing well while cleaning bright/white tiles or hardwood?**

Which smart radiator valves for integration in Home Assistant?,"I'm looking to replace all 3 of my existing regular radiator valves with smart ones, that i can integrate in my Home Assistant system running on my raspberry pi. I have zigbee available with a cc2531 stick.

"Battery operated dry contact relay to act as a thermostat, looking for suggestions","I have a few Xiaomi Temperature and Humidity sensors in the house. I also have an ancient Swedish forced air electric heating system, which has been hacked and modified by previous owners. It is connected to a thermostat that seems to switch the furnace on and off by closing a contact which has low voltage in it. I would like to replace that thermostat with something I can control with my phone.  


I originally thought I'd just get a Mi Hub and an Aquara relay, but it was pointed out to me that the relay works on 230V (Europe) and it is not possible to simply connect it instead of the existing thermostat. I need something which has its own power, ideally battery, that is able to close a separate circuit (the one where the furnace gets its signal from).

"TP-Link HS200 off with only one black wire, or flickers with two"," Hello!  


I'm trying to connect a couple TP-Link HS200s around my house. Unfortunately, I'm running into issues in 2 locations.  


First is a light switch in a 2 gang box with a GFCI outlet. This one has 1 black wire, 1 white wire, and ground. Here, the switch has power, but cannot turn the light on. I assume this is because one powers the switch, and the other is the load to the light. Is there a way I could chain off the GFCI power?

Which System to use?,"Hey there, I'm just starting out with getting proper Home Automation and am looking at what system to use for it.

Since there are many Shelly devices already built into my house, I'd like to stick with them.

There are some rather special points to match for me, so I thought I'd just ask the more experienced people here:

**What I'm looking for:**

* Fast and reliable system (near-realtime communication would be great)
* Self hosted (no 3rd party cloud services)
* Neat looking Android-App and - if possible - a WebUI aswell.
* Should **not** rely on Multicast, as the devices and clients are spread out over multiple networks
* Broad range of automation options (like conditional instructions etc.)

**Solutions I'm looking at:** (that are compatible to my devices)

* MQTT
* OpenHAB
* HomeAssistant
* ioBroker
* Domoticz
* Nymea

If anyone has some informations about one of these for me, whether they work well for you or not, why you'd advise for or against one, I'd be very happy to hear from you.

Whilst writing this, I'm read through all the details of the different systems and it's just overwhelming. So please don't see this post as a call to let others make my work, I'm just looking for some feedback from people who're already experienced and might have something to tell that won't be mentioned in specsheets, or similar.

Is there anyway to automate the outdoor rolling/unrolling a large amount of material to block a neighbor's lights?,"Hello,

This is a [x-post that I put on Home Improvement](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/k18faj/anyway_to_block_a_neighbors_flood_lights_without/) asking about blocking a lights shining from a neighbor. Ideally, I wanted to have some sort of automated way of rolling/unrolling or moving some material that would block the lights. I understand I may not have been perfectly clear with that. Also, I think there is a different mindset in this subreddit.

While I got some good feedback, my focus is not doing anything to antagonize the neighbor or do anything illegal. If this eventually comes to a legal situation/solution, I want to be in the clear of having done anything wrong. So my thinking was just put up something to block his lights that doesn't affect him.

The ideal would be a roll of about 40 feet x 4 feet of material that could be spread across a fence automatically.

Any suggestions if this can be achieved (or other ideas), or am I just dreaming?

Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the text from the post:

 \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

I hope this is an appropriate place to ask this question. I thought all those with building skills/experience might have some good suggestions.

I have a neighbor who has installed these very bright flood lights that he does not turn off, even when he's not home. I have spoken to him a few times (very diplomatically) and given him some suggestions so he can keep the lights on, just redirect them, or shade them so they don't shine onto my property and be a potential cause of my spouse's migraines (While it is true my spouse gets several migraines a month, these lights have not directly caused one...yet). For some reason keeping his driveway and backyard fully lit until 1:00 AM is more important that my spouse's health (which he said) This is also against town code but that doesn't seem to matter to him or the code enforcers in my town - there is no enforcement despite my many emails.

Even though he's a jerk, I don't want to be. I don't want to use a BB gun or do any sort of destruction to his property, no matter how aggravating it is. I don't think I will escalate it to a legal battle, but we'll see how long my patience holds out. Who has the time for this sort of nonsense?

So, in trying to be a good person and not do any revenge lighting (he'd probably welcome it), I was wondering if there a way I could easily put up some sort of netting or light-blocking material between us? I'd like to keep it easy and inexpensive.

There is a a six-foot fence between us, that I own. I'm thinking the material would have to be light enough that the wind doesn't take it down and also easy for me to put up and take down. I don't want a giant tarp up in my backyard all day. I am thinking it should be about 40 ft x 4 ft. I did see [some mylar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083775346/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&amp;pd_rd_i=B083775346&amp;pd_rd_w=ZjbqU&amp;pf_rd_p=7d37a48b-2b1a-4373-8c1a-bdcc5da66be9&amp;pd_rd_wg=xvqmB&amp;pf_rd_r=8JYEXM3TM30ZX6M1FBG1&amp;pd_rd_r=443ef3b9-f8b8-48e4-b071-c614a273d3e8&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyUFI2SU9LT0cwSzVVJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzk2MDY4MzlUQzNGVjZZVFpGOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjg0ODU5MlpNMElIOU5PWFZTNCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2RldGFpbCZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) and it might work, but the mylar is shiny and I don't want me doing this to be a ""dick move"". I don't want to be confrontational, I just want the light gone.

My wild fantasy would be I can somehow have a automated setup that when I hit the magic button (z-wave?) and a shade is drawn or unrolled across the fence to block the light.

Smart Curtains - Somfy / Quoya / Others?,"A year or so ago I got a quote for some Somfy curtains for 5 windows (8ft by 43in) and it came to about $1,000 a window, without fabric.   I saw that there's a company called Quoya offering 'smart curtains' for sizes up to 3.2 meters wide and up to 125 inches long for like $250 a window (minus the fabric).   

Is Quota really comparable to Somfy?  They looks like they do the same thing, but the price different is huge, unless Somfy has had a price drop.  

Is there a better solution out there for automating curtains?

Smart Gate solution,"I’ve been researching options for a smart gate solution, but can’t seem to find anything that fits the needs:

I have a fenced property with a motorized gate and want to add some smarts:

- external keypad that is programmable from the internet.  Use case is to be able to add a new code for a renter for a week, then delete the code, all remotely.
- push to call functionality (voip of course) so it acts as a doorbell
-relay control via an app or API (so I can open the gate to let a delivery in)
- any kind of integration with a camera so I can grab a frame from a camera when the talk button is pushed (camera is unifi wired g3 camera)
-Poe powered would be bonus points to simplify wiring and power requirements
-outdoor rated gear and hardened since this will be mounted on a pole outside the gate.

These capabilities all exist for doorbells and smart-locks; but not in components I can put together for a gate.  Anyone come up with a solution like this?

One idea is to wire an actual smart doorbell and a wife access point down by the gate and use a few apps to accomplish this.

How I my normal(dumb) washing machine announces it is completed through Alexa,"My washing machine is in the basement and I do not always hear the chime when it finishes. I was able to have Alexa say ""The washing machine has completed"" when the cycle finishes. This is how I did it. I would love feedback if anyone has a cleaner solution. 

1. I had a smart plug. I used a higher W plug ([1800W, 15A Plug](https://www.amazon.com/TOPGREENER-Monitoring-Appliances-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B07FDFLFJL/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n2_0?cv_ct_cx=smart+plug&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=smart+plug&amp;pd_rd_i=B07FDFLFJL&amp;pd_rd_r=089498ff-b23a-4d16-9ec2-9d76282b34fc&amp;pd_rd_w=CvMiL&amp;pd_rd_wg=yFnEd&amp;pf_rd_p=1835a2a9-7ed8-48dc-ad07-fcd7527bd2bc&amp;pf_rd_r=09TP4CR1VPP1PPT63CSK&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1606331639&amp;sr=1-2-80ba0e26-a1cd-4e7b-87a0-a2ffae3a273c)) because I was unsure of the power draw the machine would use. However, I think I could have used the normal smart plug(just make sure it has the ability to monitor power levels) because during my monitoring the power draw does not appear to get that high. Someone please correct me on this, if you know more. 
2. These plugs use the ""Smart Life"" app which has a feature for ""Energy Monitoring"".
   1. (Android) In the main home screen on the app hit ""smart"" at the bottom.
   2. Then hit the ""+"" in the top right corner to create a smart condition.
   3. Select ""when device status changes""
   4. Select your plug
   5. Select what you want to monitor. In my case I used ""Power"".
   6. Select the condition. In my example, I said ""=0W"". However, I think this is not exactly right and currently doing a little more testing. I figured, when the cycle finishes it won't draw more power. However, I have found that it does drop to 0 but then goes up to 3.8 and back to zero, and repeats this. I think I will test out ""&lt;4W"". 
   7. Hit Next to set up a task. I do 2 things. Firstly, I send notification. This sends me a message to my phone that the washer is done. For most of us, this is probably good enough... However I wanted Alexa to announce so I, secondly, (and here where the hacky part starts) I tell the app to shut off the plug as part of this trigger.... Simply put, when the plug uses 0 W, text me and then shut off the plug. 
3. In IFTTT, I set up an applet. This app triggers when the (smart life) plug turns off. When that triggers, I use sendAlexaActionByMkzense([https://mkzense.com/iftttrigger](https://mkzense.com/iftttrigger)) to run a routine in the Alexa App on my phone. 
   1. Then, go into your Alexa app on your phone. You will need to enable the Skill ""IFTTTrigger"". This will create 3 ""Smart Home Devices"". I named one of them ""washing machine"". A youtube video for how to set this up [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMr6ZrHia2Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMr6ZrHia2Q) [https://mkzense.com/iftttrigger](https://mkzense.com/iftttrigger)
   2. Go back to IFTTT to select the correct trigger to use with the sendAlexaActionByMkzense app. 
   3. Create a new routine in the Alexa app.
      1. Name it whatever you want.
      2. When this happens - Select Smart home, and then select your trigger created. 
      3. Add Action - Select ""Alexa Says"" and type in what you want her to say. I went with ""Your washing machine has completed.""
      4. (optional last step) - I am still trying to clean this up, but I also added an action to turn the plug back on. However, since my current trigger is set off when the plug = 0 W, it seems to be fluctuating between 4 and 0. It appears to be in a loop lol. I am think I may just turn not run this step and let the plug stay off. I can just hit the button when I do a load of laundry.

"Hiding the clutter of hubs, Raspberry Pi, etc","Hi,

I was wondering how people have dealt with the multiple wires and pieces of kit that a home automation system seems to accumulate?

My Sky router has two ethernet ports. At the moment one of those is connected to my NAS and the other to my Philips Hue hub. A Raspberry Pi, for Home Bridge, is getting delivered today and I've already run out of ports!

The Sky Router is ugly. The WD NAS and Philips Hue hub are okay looking. The Raspberry Pi looks kinda cool. However, all together it looks like a jumble sale of electronic parts sat on a small table next to the phone socket!

One idea I have is to buy a couple of WiFi Mesh devices. One will plug into the phone socket and look pleasing to the eye there! The other one will go in a cupboard and have an 5 or 8 port ethernet switch connected to it which all the other stuff will plug into.

Questions:

1. Will this work?
2. How have other people got around this?

Thanks,

Thanks,  ​  ​  Chris",Hiding the clutter of hubs Raspberry Pi etc Hi I was wondering how people have dealt with the multiple wires and pieces of kit that a home automation system seems to accumulate My Sky router has two ethernet ports At the moment one of those is connected to my NAS and the other to my Philips Hue hub A Raspberry Pi for Home Bridge is getting delivered today and I've already run out of ports The Sky Router is ugly The WD NAS and Philips Hue hub are okay looking The Raspberry Pi looks kinda cool However all together it looks like a jumble sale of electronic parts sat on a small table next to the phone socket One idea I have is to buy a couple of WiFi Mesh devices One will plug into the phone socket and look pleasing to the eye there The other one will go in a cupboard and have an 5 or 8 port ethernet switch connected to it which all the other stuff will plug into Questions 1 Will this work 2 How have other people got around this Thanks ​ ​ Chris
Is the Roborock E4 unparalleled in its price range?,"So, according to most reviews I've seen, the E4 from Roborock, which often goes for under $200, is a great vacuum. It has the same suction as the more expensive S5 at 2000pa, 19 cfm of airflow - better than some high-end vacuums, a very large battery, and a somewhat sophisticated navigation system. And it seems to prevent most tangles, and I live with a large labrador that *sheds a lot*! 

I was eyeing the Neato D4 because of its large bin and great navigation system, but it cannot map multiple floors (which isn't an issue with the E4, as it has no mapping), and it is 50% more expensive than the E4.

To me, it seems that the E4 is almost as good as a high-end vacuum, especially since I don't care about the app features way too much. But why don't I see it more often when I search for ""best budget vacuums""?

"Monitoring Electric Dryer - Looking to simplify. (240V/30A ""smart plug""???)","Greetings fellow Automators.

**Short Version:** I need what's essentially a Smart Plug that would work for an electric dryer. Circuit is 240V/30A. It needs to be WiFi-enabled, support power use monitoring, and ideally have some sort of REST API I can interface with.

**Looooong Version:** Our story begins with teenagers that forget they put a load of laundry in the washer and promptly forget they did so for 2-3 days. By that time, of course, there's funk in the air, and the clothes need to be rewashed.

I had an awesome solution involving a Wemo smart plug that monitored energy use and IFTTT (please, don't make this an IFTTT-hate thread), which fired off a message to a Telegram Group Chat that all of us in the house are subscribed to. Then Wemo had to go and ""improve"" things, after which, IFTTT never worked again.

One of the guys who works on my team suggested the Etekcity plugs from Amazon, knowing they also supported IFTTT. Unfortunately, their IFTTT support doesn't include triggers based on power usage, like the old Wemo did. So, naturally, me &amp; that guy spent some time with Postman and the source code to the VeSync python API as well as the Homebridge module, figuring out how to login to the API, then figuring out how to read out just the info for a specific device, and blammo, [my code was born](https://github.com/jcostom/plugmon).

Unfortunately, the dryer isn't as easy. We've got an electric dryer. I could swap for gas and then use the same code I've already written for the washer, but dropping $1k on a new dryer just to get notifications doesn't seem like the smartest use of our $$. So, for the time being at least, I'm stuck with the electric dryer. It's the older 3-pin plug on a 240V/30A breaker.

I saw folks playing around with Arduinos and CT clamps. I got myself a Huzzah32, loaded up Micropython, and was reading from the ADC-enabled GPIO pins relatively quickly. Unfortunately, I couldn't make sense out of the readings I was getting and eventually just gave up on that. I ended up swapping out for a Raspberry Pi connected to an 801s vibration sensor that had both Analog and Digital outputs. I'm using the digital output, since I don't really care how much the dryer is vibrating - I care \*that\* it's vibrating. The solution spans 2 project boxes - 1 on the wall that houses the Pi, another that just has the sensor, which is on the back of the dryer. More code and it's working. The code was finicky to get going. The [code is ugly](https://github.com/jcostom/vibinator) (Hey, I'm not a real programmer, I just pretend to be one on teh Interwebs) and literally takes thousands of averaged readings to work out if the dryer is really on, or just got bumped somehow.

Anyhow, back to the point. I'd like a solution that doesn't involve multiple boxes, adding compute power to my laundry room, and can be interfaced with remotely via a REST API. Anyone know of such a beast? My budget is up to $100, though I'm reasonably flexible on that, as I just pulled that number out of thin air.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-25 20:52:14,"Monitoring Electric Dryer - Looking to simplify.

The solution spans 2 project boxes - 1 on the wall that houses the Pi, another that just has the sensor, which is on the back of the dryer. More code and it's working. The code was finicky to get going. The [code is ugly]  (Hey, I'm not a real programmer, I just pretend to be one on teh Interwebs) and literally takes thousands of averaged readings to work out if the dryer is really on, or just got bumped somehow.  Anyhow, back to the point. I'd like a solution that doesn't involve multiple boxes, adding compute power to my laundry room, and can be interfaced with remotely via a REST API. Anyone know of such a beast?

Continuing with my humble home-made security system: alarm siren speaker now,"Hi again. I'm about to make an order on Amazon but the last step, for now (this hobby never ends), is a battery-powered alarm siren speaker. It'll be hidden somewhere. It needs to be loud. In case I buy a UPS in the near future, so that both the router and the Raspberry Pi + ConBee II will continue to work in case a burglar turns off the power of the apartment or something, even if there's no power in the apartment the loud siren will sound as soon as a burglar enters.

This would fail if the burglars used a frequency jammer, of course, but the type of burglar that burglarizes the kind of place I live in is not that sophisticated, in my opinion. Here that happens more at houses and not at humble small apartments. When we got burglarized through a balcony a few years ago, the bastards were probably very fast and were only looking for money and jewels. But anyway, it would still be interesting to see what you guys think about the risk of burglars using a frequency jammer and how you handle the issue.

Anyway, sorry I'm rambling. Any cheap battery-powered siren speaker that you recommend? Does Aqara or Xiaomi have one? Are they usually Zigbee or Wi-Fi? If they're Wi-Fi, can you make them play an mp3?

Turning on Netatmo Thermostat via another tempature sensor?,"Hi!

I just got a netatmo thermostat and it works awesome, however because I just replaced my 2 wire already wired up thermostat with it, the temp sensor is in the hall which is warmer than the room which we are in most of the time.  
We have a netatmo healthy home coach in the room meassure tempature, and I was wondering if it was possible to link the two somehow either via HomeKit or somekind of rapsberry solution.  
Or should I just balance it out by setting it higher in the hall and that would be the easiest?

Anybody have any experience with this?

How I made the cheapest home cctv system with Wyze Cams and HLS,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ue6tpcxc7b161.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74900039606560a0dfe8d29d5a82158c4f59bf0d

Hello there. I would like to share my experience with making the cheapest home cctv system. 

I'm a fan of WyzeCams and was trying to fit it into my smart home system for a while.

It's super cheap and specs are pretty good, but the only flaw is not stable RTSP firmware.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a solution that allows you to convert mp4 files from NFS to HLS stream.

That HLS stream could be fed to any modern video surveillance system.

Here is the URL to my repo: [https://github.com/n1ckyrush/wyzecam-hls](https://github.com/n1ckyrush/wyzecam-hls)

It's pretty simple nodejs script with ffmpeg. 

It's based on NFS hack (props to the original author!), you will find all instructions inside my repo.

&amp;#x200B;

After many months of fighting with RTSP and Wyze now it works flawlessly.

Hopefully it will make somebody life easier ✊

Feel free to shoot me any questions.

P.S. If you are interested in my whole journey with it, I made a long post about it: [https://n1ckyrush.com/en/blog/3-how-to-make-wyzecam-stream-stable-hls-instead-of-rtsp](https://n1ckyrush.com/en/blog/3-how-to-make-wyzecam-stream-stable-hls-instead-of-rtsp)",r/homeautomation,2020-11-25 03:56:15,How I made the cheapest home cctv system with Wyze Cams and HLS,"​     Hello there.

"Is Nest the best, or should I switch to ecobee? New house has 3 separate HVAC systems...","Moving to a new house and the new HVAC set up is a bit more widespread and unique. Basically, here is what I am dealing with to make it smart:

- mini split system heat/cool main floor (same condenser as central air, separate controls with remote)

Shelly 2.5 on single fuse or two fuses?,"I just got a Shelly 2.5 (https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-25-smart-home-automation-relay/) and I plan on using it to control a light switch and a fan in a two-gang box.

After taking the face plate off, I found out that the light switch is on a separate fuse from the fan (meaning if I turn off the fuse for the light switch, the fan can still work, I have to flip a separate fuse to turn the fan off).

So the question is, can the Shelly 2.5 work on 2 separate fuses?  One fuse to control the light and another fuse to control fan.

Wireless Meter Bus - Heat and Water meter,"Hey,

In my living complex the meters are „smart“ meters and uses the Wireless Meter Bus Standard ....so I thought I can gat the current values via this protocol and have some statistics about my consumption. But I‘m struggling a bit with this Protocoll....so I‘ve done some research and found this [USB-Stick](https://shop.imst.de/wireless-modules/usb-radio-products/10/im871a-usb-wireless-m-bus-usb-adapter-868-mhz#) and this [Software](https://github.com/weetmuts/wmbusmeters) but I‘m unsure if I need anything else like an AES Key etc. WMBus is a protocol used in Europe, but im unsure if there is not enough infos on the web or maybe im incompetent to google this, but im finding not many infos for this standard.

My landlord is using this system to bill the tenants so maybe he has the AES Keys. I hope somebody is also using some sort of this setup and can share their experience .

Best voice assistant for only triggering automations?,"I've been using Home Assistant for most of my automations and have found it cumbersome to trigger a Home Assistant routine via Alexa and Google devices: I need to come up with clunky automation names to not confuse the assistant, the trigger phrasing is hard to fully customize, and I often find myself repeating myself to get things to work. 

I think part of this is because the assistants are geared towards doing a lot more than just home automation, so even though I may only have a dozen commands I want them to respond to, they are trying to do a lot more and thus are easily confused.

SwitchBot Curtain Review,"This is a review of my experience with the SwitchBot Curtain, purchased through a crowdfunding site. I tested the device on two sets of curtains, both grommet and back-tab styles. The curtains are moderately heavy, and mounted on extendable rods.

I have a number of home automation devices, controlled through both SmartThings and Google Home, and tested integrating it with my setup.

# Opening and closing curtains

As the main purpose of SwitchBot Curtain is to actually open and close your curtains, you'd expect it to do this well. Unless you have a very basic curtain setup of single non-adjustable rod with lightweight curtain, you'll likely be disappointed here. Perhaps the experience is better with rail style curtains?

* Gets stuck on the ""bump"" where curtain rod extends from wider to narrower width. That's a pretty big showstopper, and especially surprising since SwitchBot *specifically advertises it handling this situation*. My curtains open in the middle, so I was able to get one side working. Yay? Other people have had the same complaint on Kickstarter, but the company has not posted any public response other than to contact them through the app feedback. Some people have gotten it to work by smoothing the transition out with tape, but I think that workaround would look ugly personally.

* The Touch &amp; Go feature is supposed to assist when you try to operate the curtains by hand. Instead, nothing happens and the device actually makes it harder to move the curtain.

* The plastic hook part that goes over your rod projects a fair bit from towards your wall. If you have a double curtain rod, this might not be enough space. This was the case with one of my curtains, although I was able to get it working but flipping it around (which makes the calibration backwards, and puts the solar panel input port on the wrong side, but it works).

## Noise

It's not so noisy to be bothersome, but definitely loud enough that I wouldn't want to use it while I'm asleep. This defeats the use case of gently waking you up with some natural light before your alarm. You can also choose a ""silent"" mode which promises quiet while sacrificing some power to move heavier curtains. As the silent mode is more of a high pitched shriek, I decided to stick with the normal mode lest people think I'm torturing my curtains.


## Hardware

The overall build quality is decent. None of the little plastic parts broke during installation. The solar panels connect nicely to a port on the back, and come with a usb c cable if you need to mount them elsewhere. (I have not done enough testing with the solar panels yet to offer a review on them. My rod is either mounted too high, or not getting enough light in the winter, for them to charge.)


# Automation

Connecting to the device remotely or through other services requires an additional purchase of a SwitchBot Hub Mini. It's small and has limited range, although one Hub Mini can control multiple curtains if they are close enough. You can also connect other SwitchBot devices to the same hub. It would be nice if this could connect via zigbee, zwave, or wifi directly without another hub, but it does work.

It comes with some basic automation in the SwitchBot app, as well as compatibility with other home automation and voice assistant systems.

## Native App

You can schedule it to open or close for a specific time and days of the week. But you can't set it based on sunrise/sunset, exterior light level, or synced with your alarm, so I wouldn't recommend using this feature.

Even with the cloud connection working, it doesn't seem to be able to change curtain settings here from a different room in the house.

## Google Home

Simple to set up, and voice commands work as expected!

## SmartThings

Simple to setup the connection, but the actual automation settings are a bit confusing. In setting up my ""if"" condition, I can select closed, open, partially open, ""open or closed"", or a shade level percentage. In the ""then"" statement, I can only select shade level percentage. Does partially open include all the way open? Is shade level 100% open or closed? Who knows without experimenting. I'm not sure if this is on SmartThings' end or Switchbot's.

# Customer Service

My experience with customer service was great! They promptly replied to my problem and **issued a full refund**, no hassle there. For backers, they also included extra hooks and curtain clips, which is a nice bonus in case they break.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-25 06:23:15,SwitchBot Curtain Review,"This is a review of my experience with the SwitchBot Curtain, purchased through a crowdfunding site.

If you have a double curtain rod, this might not be enough space. This was the case with one of my curtains, although I was able to get it working but flipping it around (which makes the calibration backwards, and puts the solar panel input port on the wrong side, but it works).  ## Noise  It's not so noisy to be bothersome, but definitely loud enough that I wouldn't want to use it while I'm asleep. This defeats the use case of gently waking you up with some natural light before your alarm. You can also choose a ""silent"" mode which promises quiet while sacrificing some power to move heavier curtains. As the silent mode is more of a high pitched shriek, I decided to stick with the normal mode lest people think I'm torturing my curtains.   ## Hardware  The overall build quality is decent. None of the little plastic parts broke during installation. The solar panels connect nicely to a port on the back, and come with a usb c cable if you need to mount them elsewhere. (I have not done enough testing with the solar panels yet to offer a review on them. My rod is either mounted too high, or not getting enough light in the winter, for them to charge.)   # Automation  Connecting to the device remotely or through other services requires an additional purchase of a SwitchBot Hub Mini. It's small and has limited range, although one Hub Mini can control multiple curtains if they are close enough. You can also connect other SwitchBot devices to the same hub. It would be nice if this could connect via zigbee, zwave, or wifi directly without another hub, but it does work.  It comes with some basic automation in the SwitchBot app, as well as compatibility with other home automation and voice assistant systems.  ## Native App  You can schedule it to open or close for a specific time and days of the week. But you can't set it based on sunrise/sunset, exterior light level, or synced with your alarm, so I wouldn't recommend using this feature.  Even with the cloud connection working, it doesn't seem to be able to change curtain settings here from a different room in the house.  ## Google Home  Simple to set up, and voice commands work as expected!  ## SmartThings  Simple to setup the connection, but the actual automation settings are a bit confusing. In setting up my ""if"" condition, I can select closed, open, partially open, ""open or closed"", or a shade level percentage. In the ""then"" statement, I can only select shade level percentage. Does partially open include all the way open? Is shade level 100% open or closed? Who knows without experimenting. I'm not sure if this is on SmartThings' end or Switchbot's.  # Customer Service  My experience with customer service was great!

I tested the device on two sets of curtains, both grommet and back-tab styles. The curtains are moderately heavy, and mounted on extendable rods.  I have a number of home automation devices, controlled through both SmartThings and Google Home, and tested integrating it with my setup.  # Opening and closing curtains  As the main purpose of SwitchBot Curtain is to actually open and close your curtains, you'd expect it to do this well. Unless you have a very basic curtain setup of single non-adjustable rod with lightweight curtain, you'll likely be disappointed here. Perhaps the experience is better with rail style curtains?  * Gets stuck on the ""bump"" where curtain rod extends from wider to narrower width. That's a pretty big showstopper, and especially surprising since SwitchBot *specifically advertises it handling this situation*. My curtains open in the middle, so I was able to get one side working. Yay? Other people have had the same complaint on Kickstarter, but the company has not posted any public response other than to contact them through the app feedback. Some people have gotten it to work by smoothing the transition out with tape, but I think that workaround would look ugly personally.  * The Touch & Go feature is supposed to assist when you try to operate the curtains by hand.

Smart millivolt wall switch,"We have moved into a new house with a gas fireplace controlled by a wall switch.

Help determine if I have a neutral wire,"I’m want to replace a dimmer, specifically, with a smart switch and was going to order the GE Z-Wave Smart Dimmer. It says a neutral wire is required, and I *think* I have them (circled in the third photo linked below) but they don’t appear to be connected to any of the switches and it looks like they all terminate in a wire nut. Is that accurate?

If that’s the case, do I just pick any of them and connect it to the GE switch or do I have to pick a specific neutral wire? 

If that’s not the case, what other smart dimmer would you recommend that doesn’t require a neutral that works with LED bulbs?

Thanks so much for your help!

Smart bulb with local http API?,"Hi,  


I'm just getting into home automation so I'm not really aware of what's out there and was hoping someone could point me in the right direction for this. I'm looking for some light bulbs that I can control completely locally without an internet connection.  


An ideal candidate would be something with a simple get/post http API. For example, the smart outlets I have now can be controlled through simple requests like hostname/cm?cmnd=power%20on.  


So far the only smart bulbs I can find require a cloud service/internet connection though, which is a no-go for me.

The switch was audibly clicking with each on and off so you could definitely hear the power being cut. A quick google returned a Reddit thread where someone else experienced this and the cause mentioned was a bad relay. 

Are GE switches known for this? I have a few others with zero problems but didn’t wanna pick up another if they are known to do this after a few years. 

I’m also running on Hubitat if that makes a difference in choice for anyone. I keep it pretty simple, just wanting my lights on at a certain time and the ability to turn on/off remotely if needed. My only complaint when I was setting up the Hubitat with them all the mesh network didn’t seem to work. Only way I got this switch connected was getting a long Ethernet cord and bringing the hub closer.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-25 00:49:50,Best smart switch,"So I just had a GE paddle switch seem to go out.

IFTTT alternative to for Magic Home...,"Since IFTTT has become another subscription model, I've deleted the account.

Either way, I have a couple LED strips setup with Magic Home controllers that work fine for voice activation and with the IR remote, although previously I used a smartThings motion sensor to activate them on the stairs through IFTTT.

Nest system basically bricked IMO,"So I bought a nest camera/alarm system in 2017. And it was great. In late 2018 I really started to get into Home automation and the works with nest system worked out with Alexa. I like that you can ask Alexa to show a camera and it throws it on the tv. However I’m annoyed by how limited things are when google bought nest. As if I’ve lost functionality after paying the heavy price tag for nest equipment 

So ignorantly when google bought nest I migrated my account thinking things would be fine. But they were not fine. I’m annoyed that not only IFTTT is basically disabled but I’m also annoyed that you really can’t utilize the motion detection to turn on lights. Most annoying, I would love to use google nest hub/Alexa show to alert me while I’m sleeping if people are on porch deck. However it only alerts google nest hub if they ring the doorbell and not for general recognizing of people on my porch in the middle of the night.

Control Smart Life RGB without cloud using Home Assistant?,"(question at the end)

Context: 
I have a bunch of Smart Life lights (Tuya) which are either Sengled or Lumiman.
They work with my Google Home app as well as the Smart Life app as well as Lumia Stream on PC.

In general, I am able to control on-off and preset colours using either of the apps listed above.

I've come up with a Python Script which is able to find the dominant colour of my screen and I wanted to sync this with my lights for ""mood lighting"".

Initially it worked decently with IFTTT but the lag was ridiculous as there were too many hops. Also, I am limited to 8 preset colours and 10 brightness levels.

I came across Home Assistant and it looks awesome and likely my way forward (especially with IFTTT no longer an option as such).

Question:
My question is if I can connect my Tuya based coloured smart lights _locally_ (without internet) to my Home Assistant/PC with Python Script to control RGB colours?

Otherwise, am I limited to investing in Phillips Hue?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-24 22:07:09,Control Smart Life RGB without cloud using Home Assistant?,"(question at the end)  Context:  I have a bunch of Smart Life lights (Tuya) which are either Sengled or Lumiman.

Broadlink RM4 Pro RF Unreliable,"I'm having issues with Smith &amp; Noble blinds (Somfy rebadged I think). I learned the remote on the broadlink app and hooked it into Google Home. It works sometimes, but by no means is it reliable. Google recognizes the commands, however, sometimes the shades just don't move.

They are RF 433.92.

Does anyone have any experience? Could this be a bad RM4 Pro? Bad Internet (it's been a bit spotty with some packet loss), or potentially is the RF code from the remote done in a way that makes it difficult for broadlink to learn?

  
How do you typically debug issues like this? Does broadlink have an activity log somewhere?

Can I do something useful/creative with an unused iPhone X?,"Hi all,

I have an iPhone X with a bad IMEI (long story, but I got my money back and got to keep the phone!), and I'm trying to think of a practical use for it.

LED Crimp Pins,"I made an LED strip integrated into a book shelf.  I made the extension cables with a combination of splicing the existing connectors and making some dupont connectors.  I had a hard time getting the male connectors I made into the female sockets.  It seemed like the pins were just barely too big (diameter).  They were also too long, but that didn't affect things much, but I would prefer if they were shorter so that the connection closed all the way with no exposed pin.  I had originally intended to make all of the extensions and just not use the ones provided, but after having so much trouble, I decided to splice where I could.

So I have a question about the male crimp pins.  Maybe I just have a low quality one (very likely).  Are there different types?  The ones that I have look like they were stamped out of a sheet.  I think if I had one where it was a solid piece with a nice sharp point, I wouldn't have had these troubles.  I tried searching around for jst-xh male pins, and dupont male crimp pins.  Do this higher quality male pin exist?  If I do more of these, I want to avoid going through the trouble with the pins if possible.

Is there some other even easier way that is still reasonably priced?

They were also too long, but that didn't affect things much, but I would prefer if they were shorter so that the connection closed all the way with no exposed pin.  I had originally intended to make all of the extensions and just not use the ones provided, but after having so much trouble, I decided to splice where I could.  So I have a question about the male crimp pins.  Maybe I just have a low quality one (very likely).  Are there different types?  The ones that I have look like they were stamped out of a sheet.  I think if I had one where it was a solid piece with a nice sharp point, I wouldn't have had these troubles.  I tried searching around for jst-xh male pins, and dupont male crimp pins.  Do this higher quality male pin exist?  If I do more of these, I want to avoid going through the trouble with the pins if possible.  Is there some other even easier way that is still reasonably priced?  I like the idea of making my own connecting wire, because I can then have any length I want.",LED Crimp Pins I made an LED strip integrated into a book shelf I made the extension cables with a combination of splicing the existing connectors and making some dupont connectors I had a hard time getting the male connectors I made into the female sockets It seemed like the pins were just barely too big diameter They were also too long but that didn't affect things much but I would prefer if they were shorter so that the connection closed all the way with no exposed pin I had originally intended to make all of the extensions and just not use the ones provided but after having so much trouble I decided to splice where I could So I have a question about the male crimp pins Maybe I just have a low quality one very likely Are there different types The ones that I have look like they were stamped out of a sheet I think if I had one where it was a solid piece with a nice sharp point I wouldn't have had these troubles I tried searching around for jst-xh male pins and dupont male crimp pins Do this higher quality male pin exist If I do more of these I want to avoid going through the trouble with the pins if possible Is there some other even easier way that is still reasonably priced I like the idea of making my own connecting wire because I can then have any length I want

Best Front Porch Smartlock? (w/ photos),"Hi! I’m trying to replace some locks on my new house and I have no idea what the best system may be as I seem to experiencing some analysis paralysis at this point. Any help all you knowledgeable people are willing to provide would be much appreciated!

I would like to replace my front porch lock and front door lock at the very least. At most I would like to add an additional smart lock to my back gate and back door. I will post some photos for reference. I have Alexa set up in the house but also have Nest products for the thermostat and smoke detectors and what not. Not married to any one system.

The main issue I run into with the front porch lock is I am not sure if there is a system that will work in the footprint that the current lock exists within. Particularly on the back side of the lock which has a metal box around it. (See photo)

Please Help! Independently control multiple lights from one switch.,"Hello fellow enthusiasts!

In my kitchen I have one wall switch that originally ran to a single florescent light. Many years ago a junction box was installed behind the florescent light and new wiring was added to ceiling boxes 6 ft from each end of the florescent fixture and track lighting was installed on those ceiling boxes. For the past 9 years the one switch has turned on the florescent light and the two sets of track lighting.

Ideally I am looking for a way to control each of the three groups of lights independently without trying to run new wiring down the wall. However, I would be happy if I could at least control the florescent light independently of the other two.
I would like some type of physical switch to turn them on and off and I would prefer they integrate with SmartThings so I can control them from my phone/Google Home/Alexa. 

If I needed to keep a dumb switch to turn them all on or all off that would be fine as long as I had voice control to turn them on/off independently.

I have searched the internet multiple times over the past year and can't seem to find what I'm looking for, or I'm just not looking for the right thing.

Flush wall mountable proximity sensor,"I would like to add two proximity sensors to my stairs. One at the top and one at the bottom. Whenever a person would step on the first step, I would like to stair lights to turn on. The thing is that I can't find a wall mountable flush sensor for European standards that I could use.

There are PIR motion sensors, but I don't think they would be my best choice, because we move past the stairs and I don't want the lights to turn on when somebody passes by the stairs. I want them to turn on only when someone actually want's to go up/down.

Moving into new house - what type of keypad would work with this door?,"I'm a noob here, so appreciate the help!

I'm closing on a house next week and want to install keypad locks. Ideally, will have one on the front door and one for the garage door.

My front door handle is pictured here. Can I tell from this photo what smart locks will be compatible? Unfortunately, don't have a picture of the inside. Do I need to know what the inside looks like to know what to buy?

Ideal functionality:

1. Enter code to get in (no key needed)
2. Can use the physical key as backup
3. \[Stretch goal -- is this doable?\]  Door unlocks when it senses my smartphone or my wife's smartphone nearby...so that I don't need to enter the password in that case

TYIA! 🙏

Z-Wave Hub working with unstable internet?,"Hello. This is my first time considering a smart hub, as I've got barely any smart appliances. My internet connection drops at random times, and sometimes I even have to reset the router for it to work again.

In case you wanted to know what a smart home is like during a brownout...,"Our lights were intermittently flickering at our house today, so I called the utility company who sent somebody out at record speed to investigate. After finding no issues with our house or meter, he started looking upstream at the various taps in our neighborhood.

The utility worker found a tap that needed to be replaced because a rubber sheath had melted (likely *because* of a poor connection) and he let us know that we should not lose power during the replacement process because they were wired in parallel (whatever that means in the context of power distribution).

Unfortunately, in the process of replacing equipment, we ended up with a rare brownout. For those unfamiliar, this is where you get only a portion of the voltage to your house. All sorts of weird shit happens with electronics, and lightbulbs will operate at a reduced brightness. 

I’m speculating we only had 1 hot leg of 2 and some electricity was going to neutral, but I’m not super well versed on household circuits. 

But to get to the point... I have about 10 smart dimmers and smart outlets and I can confidently report they do not tolerate brownouts well. At least half of them started spazzing out, clicking on and off rapidly. Some of them have an air gap you can pull, and some of them do not. I was really confused, because some of the LEDs in my house were working just fine but other stuff was not. So, I ran out to my breaker panel and shut off the main service disconnect to the house.

Fortunately, every piece of decent electronics and every computer in my house had already been shut off and unplugged earlier when I noticed the lights flickering. That said, I was keeping my fingers crossed that none of my smart switches were fried from all of the power flickering and subsequent brownout.

When the lineman was done, he came and turned our service back on at the panel and everything resumed working like normal. I thoroughly tested out every device in the house and was relieved that nothing was bricked. 

Moral of the story: always know where your main service disconnect is, and only buy smart switches that have air gap breakers. And, I suppose, don’t hesitate to call the utility  company when things are fishy with your service.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-23 02:51:00,In case you wanted to know what a smart home is like during a brownout...,"Our lights were intermittently flickering at our house today, so I called the utility company who sent somebody out at record speed to investigate.

I assume can't wire up the on/off switch to the dimmer box, is this correct? I'm not worried about connecting the switch if not as it's not a light I use often (if at all).

Need advice on a WiFi and automation control for Daikin and Mitsubishi systems.,"After researching the subreddit, I've concluded that Sensibo is the recommended brand in automating my Mini Splits.

Background:
I have a mix of Daikins (2 Dual units) and Mitsubishi splits (2 Single zones):
MUZFH12NA - MSZFH12NA
MUZFH18NA - MSZFH18NA

3MXS24RMVJU---  CTXS07LVJU - FTXS12LVJU
5MXS48TVJU - (2) FTXS18LVJU


I didn't opt to have any WiFi mods to be installed when it was first installed.  

So, is the Sensibo system good to control 6 air handlers by two different brands?  And if so, what do I need to do to get it to work?  Do I need to buy several Sensibo systems?  Also, will I need to install wifi modules to 6 air handlers??

Home automation - What is resistive and what is incandescent load?,"I am in the process of replacing my in-floor heating switch to something that I can automate and control remotely. This is in a very small bathroom and the heating element must not be bigger than 4 by 3 feet, so I'm not too concerned about a max. rating of 600W, I think this should be plenty. 


The original installed manual switch/dimmer was rated as ""incandescent only 600 watt max."" - but the load was resistive! I assume it worked fine for years before I bought the house. Resistive load vs. incandescent load?


I replaced it by a programmable switch that was 1800W capable because I wanted to automate its function.


But now I'm thinking about putting in a Z-Wave switch that I can control from my home automation system.


It's just not clear to me what the difference is between an incandescent load and a resistive load since the original was designed for incandescent only loads but it was controlling underfloor heating element which, by definition, is resistive.


What is resistive and what is incandescent in my mind they're both the same?

Nest E good for me?,So I wanted to purchase a smart thermostat and was looking at the Nest E. However I'm unsure if it will work in my house.

"Everything Z wave for unity or fancier WiFi (thermostat, doorbell, garage)","Hello, I'm planning on outfitting my house with a Qolsys IQ panel 2+ and thought it would be ideal to have everything controlled through one app and my panel. The problem I'm running into is that the best devices for thermostats and door bells seem to be wifi. I'm looking at the Eufy 2K bell and the Ecobee or Nest thermostat.

Does anyone have a z wave doorbell or thermostat and have some input on it? I think the main advantage besides app unity is the complex scenes I can create. I'd like to have my security system be able to turn down the HVAC when I leave and arm the system. It would be nice to use my IQ panel for doorbell display too instead of having to pull my phone out.

Another device I'm considering is the garage door opener. Chamberlain has the WiFi MyQ, or there is a zwave controller I could wire to a regular dumb opener. I could never get MyQ to work at my current place and you need good WiFi in your garage.

I get geofencing with a z wave thermostat. The main smart feature I want that is on the Nest is the weather detection. I think the Alarm.com control can maybe check the weather and adjust a z wave thermostat but I have found any confirmation of this.

Basically do I get the fanciest device (that is wifi) and end up fragmenting my system. Trying to see if features out weigh the connectivity.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-23 15:09:19,"Everything Z wave for unity or fancier WiFi (thermostat, doorbell, garage)","Hello, I'm planning on outfitting my house with a Qolsys IQ panel 2+ and thought it would be ideal to have everything controlled through one app and my panel.

Z Wave Light Bulb,"Hey all, I'm looking for an RGB and VW lightbulb, preferably Z Wave that I can use for my bedrooms lamp. Ideally I would like to be able to turn the light on via my smart apps but also be able to use the on/off switch on the lamp itself as a fallback. So I would need a light that won't lose it's connection when we turn the lamp off and also will automatically re-sync with the rest of the network when it's turned off and will revert to last state.

Currently, I use smart switch that basically just toggles the light on/off, but when the switch is toggled off, I can't manually turn the light bulb on. I don't love this because it removes some of the functionality that the non-smart solution had.

"I don’t know anything about robot vacuums and would like to start somewhere; if anyone could point me in a specific direction, Please &amp; Thank You!","I was going to start comparing robot vacuums, but there are so many, I don’t know how to sort them all out.

Most importantly, My biggest concern is pet vomit and liquids. My cat tends to vomit liquid/food if he eats too fast and I don’t want vomit smeared everywhere, I’d rather it be ignored at the least.

Second, all this pet hair. I just rescued 2 cats for a total of 4 now, and my apartment is covered in cat hair webs. Also, my hair is about 36 inches long, so that hair too. 

My house is generally clean, except the floors; which are tile, area rugs and bathroom rugs. If I sweep, it tosses all the hair up for it to float around. Otherwise, besides hair, my floors include a good amount of kitty litter, cat toys and shoe laces. 

When using a standard cheap upright vacuum, I can get about 70% of the hair out of the rugs. When I use a dyson vacuum on high suction, it removes about 99% of the hair from my carpets and comforter.

Basically, I’d like the hair and litter to be removed, pet vomit to stay and it’s important that it actually cleans all of my floors vs just bumping into things and winging it or leaving patches behind.

If you feel a robot vacuum may not be for me, I would appreciate that recommendation as well, and I will simply get a nicer upright vacuum that treats carpet and tile floors and can be used on a comforter.

Recommendation for Routine Trigger for Alarm,"I have an ADT wired system. I have screen-enabled Alexa devices throughout the house. I also have Wyze cams throughout the house. 

Alexa now has the ability to trigger any action you want in a routine via a customizable “text to trigger” command. 

I’ve tried this on things like “when motion sensor detects motion between XYZ times, show me the living room”. And now I can see right from my nightstand the living room every time there’s motion at night. It’s great. 

I want to extend this to my ADT alarm. When the alarm goes off, BOTH Alexa Guard AND the Wyze alarm detection feature will be triggered. I want this to also trigger a camera feed of my front door or foyer, however the Wyze alarm detection can’t currently trigger an Alexa routine nor can guard alerts. 

Any ideas how to achieve this? I can’t think of a way that a virtual switch or sensor would be helpful here.

Smart Z-Wave heating thermostat,"Hello! I'm in the process of designing a complete system for my house and decided to go for a Fibaro Home Center 3 with Fibaro dimmers &amp; switches for most things.

Object detection with alerts,"Hey all! I've got an idea of what I want to accomplish, and was hoping to get some advice on where to get started.

My objective is pretty simple. We keep a puppy pad in a particular room in case our puppers has to go and we are not around to let them out. If we forget to replace the pad, they will simply go on the floor where it would have been. I've been thinking it would be nice to set up an IP cam to detect if a puppy pad is *not* on the floor and alert me so I can replace it asap.

As an object it's fairly simple, it's the classic puppy pad. White square with a blue border. Sometimes they do get folded or otherwise altered to they aren't a perfect square anymore. I imagine Machine Learning of some kind would be useful in this case.

What I have already:
HomeKit ( most of my automation are in homekit )
HomeBridge
HomeSeer ( mostly to bridge z-wave and zigbee devices to homebridge )
Hue
Aqara ( no longer using, but I've been meaning to pull it out and dust it off. HomeSeer doesn't support many Aqara devices yet )
IP cams ( I've got a Wyze ip cam, and some older Amcrest low-def cameras )

Any thoughts?

I've been thinking it would be nice to set up an IP cam to detect if a puppy pad is *not* on the floor and alert me so I can replace it asap.  As an object it's fairly simple, it's the classic puppy pad. White square with a blue border. Sometimes they do get folded or otherwise altered to they aren't a perfect square anymore. I imagine Machine Learning of some kind would be useful in this case.

HomeSeer doesn't support many Aqara devices yet ) IP cams ( I've got a Wyze ip cam, and some older Amcrest low-def cameras )  Any thoughts? Thanks!",223,4,"Object detection with alerts Hey all!

What robot vacuum should I buy? Roborock S6 MaxV or room a i7?,"Hello dear redditers.
I recently bought very own apartment, and I wanna buy a robot vacuum cleaner, because om lazy and I'd rather do as little home cleaning as possible.
My apartment is small, only 42 square meters. So I don't need anything that cleans very fast or have the best battery, but I've done some research and I think one of these would be the best buy.

It seems that the S6 is a little better, because it cleans, and according to a review that I read it has a small camera that will help it not eat wires and other small objects.

How ever the roomba also seems like a food deal, and it's on black Friday sale. So which one would you recommend?

The roomba cost 4 999 NOK, and the S6 costs 6 290 NOK

Ring floodlight camera vs separate motion sensor lights and an outdoor camera,"I am looking to add a floodlight security camera to my front porch. I found a ring floodlight camera, but it seems like a pain to install (since I don’t have wiring going to the location).

Need Advice on LED project and more,"Hey guys, first of all, I don't know much about home automation and LED, although I do have some very basic knowledge in electronic. I'm not even sure I'm in the right place but I saw a few posts here about LEDs so I guess you guys can help me a little bit. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm not sure what info I should provide.

I'm currently trying to build my own living room furniture. It's composed of 3 pieces: a multimedia cabinet with 6 shelves for my gaming consoles (ps4 &amp; ps5, XB1 and XBX and a switch), a TV stand with 3 shelves, where the bottom shelf will be a giant cable box with a built-in rackmount and the middle shelf will host my A/V receiver and finally a table with those nice looking epoxy ""river"" in the center.  


I want to wire some LED in there. I plan on having 5 different setup:

1. Each shelf of the multimedia cabinet will be lit up according to the console it host (red for nintendo, blue for playstation and green for xbox). Each shelf is 24""x24"" so a little less than 60 inch of LED per shelf, times 5 (the top shelf won't have any) for a total of approx 300"" inch of LED.
2. The central post of the multimedia cabinet (aka the cable hider) will contains 2 strips of 60"" LED, for a total of 120"". These LED will light up according to which HDMI source is selected
3. Another strip of LED behind the TV, hooked to the HDMI source so they light up according to the TV image. I plan on buying a 65"" TV sometime in the future so approximately 250"" of LED
4. Another strip of LED on the 2nd shelf of the TV stand where the A/V receiver will be. The TV stand is 24"" x 60"" so I'll need 150"" of LED
5. Finally, some LED in the epoxy ""river"" of the table. I'm still unsure of the dimension of the table, but I guess 100"" of LED would be enough

So for the multimedia cabinet, we're looking at 420"" of LED, for the TV stand it should be around 400"" and 100"" for the table, for a total of 920"" of LED. Is that too much?

Not that being said, I want to be able to control those LED remotely and change the color at will. Even more, I want to be able to program light show and stuff like that, even on the LED behind the TV and in the table. I have a strong programming background so this shouldn't be too much of an issue.

I made a lot of research in the past few days and I'm not not quite sure if I got everything right. I will probably have a different power supply per piece of furniture (so 3 total). 

For the multimedia cabinet, I will put a 5V-300W power supply and hook each shelf and the central post independently as to never exceed the limit of 200"" LED strip. I guess I will need something similar for the TV stand. For the table, a smaller power supply should be enough.

To control all those LEDs, I plan on hooking them to an ESP32 with a Raspberry Pi 4 as the central computer, so that I can easily switch mode with my phone (I'll probably build some website or an app to do it). I guess I would need 3 ESP32, one for each furniture.

The Pi4 will also be used to switch HDMI source (will should allow me to light the central post according to which HDMI source is selected) as well as probably a bunch of undefined stuff

Here's the list of material I plan to buy:

LED Setup:

* 5x LED strip: [https://www.alitove.net/product/ws2812b-300wh-np/](https://www.alitove.net/product/ws2812b-300wh-np/)
* 2x Power Supply 5v-300W: [https://www.alitove.net/product/5v-60a-t/](https://www.alitove.net/product/5v-60a-t/)
* 1x Power Supply 5v-25W: [https://www.alitove.net/product/5v-5a-bk/](https://www.alitove.net/product/5v-5a-bk/)
* 3x ESP32 micro controller: [https://www.amazon.ca/KeeYees-Development-Bluetooth-Microcontroller-ESP-WROOM-32/dp/B07QCP2451](https://www.amazon.ca/KeeYees-Development-Bluetooth-Microcontroller-ESP-WROOM-32/dp/B07QCP2451)
* LED Cover: [https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/diffuseur-transparent-transparente-aluminium-lumineuse/dp/B07KC8P2KD](https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/diffuseur-transparent-transparente-aluminium-lumineuse/dp/B07KC8P2KD) (just to make sure this is fine to do this, apparently heating can be an issue??)
* HDMI Sync Box: [https://www.amazon.ca/Philips-Hue-555227-Splitter-Required/dp/B086ZJLCTW](https://www.amazon.ca/Philips-Hue-555227-Splitter-Required/dp/B086ZJLCTW)

Cable box &amp; rackmount:

* 1x Raspberry Pi 4: [https://www.amazon.ca/CanaKit-Raspberry-Starter-Kit-8GB/dp/B08DHC7KG8](https://www.amazon.ca/CanaKit-Raspberry-Starter-Kit-8GB/dp/B08DHC7KG8)
* The HDMI switch with RS232 port for remote control [https://www.amazon.ca/TESmart-Enterprise-Control-Rackmount-Keyboard/dp/B07MJGPJN2](https://www.amazon.ca/TESmart-Enterprise-Control-Rackmount-Keyboard/dp/B07MJGPJN2)
* The power bar: [https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B072RC5NZQ](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B072RC5NZQ)
* Network switch: [https://www.custom-integration-solutions.com/store/cis-80mk1-1u-rack-mount-wireless-vpn-router/](https://www.custom-integration-solutions.com/store/cis-80mk1-1u-rack-mount-wireless-vpn-router/) (not sure about that one but the built-in WiFi looks pretty cool, although I might use a classic switch with a separate wifi access point if it cost too much)

I'm not sure the Philips Hue sync box is compatible with the LED I choose. I wouldn't mind having a different set of LED for that and not hook them on the Pi4 like the other one.

Does that make sense? Is it possible? Am I missing something?

I'm still unsure of the dimension of the table, but I guess 100"" of LED would be enough  So for the multimedia cabinet, we're looking at 420"" of LED, for the TV stand it should be around 400"" and 100"" for the table, for a total of 920"" of LED. Is that too much?  Not that being said, I want to be able to control those LED remotely and change the color at will. Even more, I want to be able to program light show and stuff like that, even on the LED behind the TV and in the table. I have a strong programming background so this shouldn't be too much of an issue.  I made a lot of research in the past few days and I'm not not quite sure if I got everything right. I will probably have a different power supply per piece of furniture (so 3 total).   For the multimedia cabinet, I will put a 5V-300W power supply and hook each shelf and the central post independently as to never exceed the limit of 200"" LED strip. I guess I will need something similar for the TV stand. For the table, a smaller power supply should be enough.  To control all those LEDs, I plan on hooking them to an ESP32 with a Raspberry Pi 4 as the central computer, so that I can easily switch mode with my phone (I'll probably build some website or an app to do it). I guess I would need 3 ESP32, one for each furniture.  The Pi4 will also be used to switch HDMI source (will should allow me to light the central post according to which HDMI source is selected) as well as probably a bunch of undefined stuff  Here's the list of material I plan to buy:  LED Setup:  * 5x LED strip: [ /] /) * 2x Power Supply 5v-300W: [ /] /) * 1x Power Supply 5v-25W: [ /] /) * 3x ESP32 micro controller: [ ]  * LED Cover: [ ]  (just to make sure this is fine to do this, apparently heating can be an issue??) * HDMI Sync Box: [ ]   Cable box & rackmount:  * 1x Raspberry Pi 4: [ ]  * The HDMI switch with RS232 port for remote control [ ]  * The power bar: [ ]  * Network switch: [ /] /) (not sure about that one but the built-in WiFi looks pretty cool, although I might use a classic switch with a separate wifi access point if it cost too much)  I'm not sure the Philips Hue sync box is compatible with the LED I choose. I wouldn't mind having a different set of LED for that and not hook them on the Pi4 like the other one.  Does that make sense? Is it possible? Am I missing something?   Thanks for your help !","Need Advice on LED project and more Hey guys first of all I don't know much about home automation and LED although I do have some very basic knowledge in electronic I'm not even sure I'm in the right place but I saw a few posts here about LEDs so I guess you guys can help me a little bit Sorry for the wall of text I'm not sure what info I should provide I'm currently trying to build my own living room furniture It's composed of 3 pieces a multimedia cabinet with 6 shelves for my gaming consoles ps4 & ps5 XB1 and XBX and a switch a TV stand with 3 shelves where the bottom shelf will be a giant cable box with a built-in rackmount and the middle shelf will host my A/V receiver and finally a table with those nice looking epoxy river in the center I want to wire some LED in there I plan on having 5 different setup 1 Each shelf of the multimedia cabinet will be lit up according to the console it host red for nintendo blue for playstation and green for xbox Each shelf is 24""x24 so a little less than 60 inch of LED per shelf times 5 the top shelf won't have any for a total of approx 300 inch of LED 2 The central post of the multimedia cabinet aka the cable hider will contains 2 strips of 60 LED for a total of 120 These LED will light up according to which HDMI source is selected 3 Another strip of LED behind the TV hooked to the HDMI source so they light up according to the TV image I plan on buying a 65 TV sometime in the future so approximately 250 of LED 4 Another strip of LED on the 2nd shelf of the TV stand where the A/V receiver will be The TV stand is 24 x 60 so I'll need 150 of LED 5 Finally some LED in the epoxy river of the table I'm still unsure of the dimension of the table but I guess 100 of LED would be enough So for the multimedia cabinet we're looking at 420 of LED for the TV stand it should be around 400 and 100 for the table for a total of 920 of LED Is that too much Not that being said I want to be able to control those LED remotely and change the color at will Even more I want to be able to program light show and stuff like that even on the LED behind the TV and in the table I have a strong programming background so this shouldn't be too much of an issue I made a lot of research in the past few days and I'm not not quite sure if I got everything right I will probably have a different power supply per piece of furniture so 3 total For the multimedia cabinet I will put a 5V-300W power supply and hook each shelf and the central post independently as to never exceed the limit of 200 LED strip I guess I will need something similar for the TV stand For the table a smaller power supply should be enough To control all those LEDs I plan on hooking them to an ESP32 with a Raspberry Pi 4 as the central computer so that I can easily switch mode with my phone I'll probably build some website or an app to do it I guess I would need 3 ESP32 one for each furniture The Pi4 will also be used to switch HDMI source will should allow me to light the central post according to which HDMI source is selected as well as probably a bunch of undefined stuff Here's the list of material I plan to buy LED Setup  5x LED strip     2x Power Supply 5v-300W     1x Power Supply 5v-25W     3x ESP32 micro controller    LED Cover   just to make sure this is fine to do this apparently heating can be an issue  HDMI Sync Box   Cable box & rackmount  1x Raspberry Pi 4    The HDMI switch with RS232 port for remote control    The power bar    Network switch    not sure about that one but the built-in WiFi looks pretty cool although I might use a classic switch with a separate wifi access point if it cost too much I'm not sure the Philips Hue sync box is compatible with the LED I choose I wouldn't mind having a different set of LED for that and not hook them on the Pi4 like the other one Does that make sense Is it possible Am I missing something Thanks for your help "

Noob Question: Home Automation bs. Google Home,"So I just bought my first home and I’m looking into setting up some basic security stuff. In the past, in rentals, I’ve had some very entry level set ups, most recently A Wink/Link hub and I really liked the ability to run If/Then type statements.

Now, the house had a Nest tstat when I bought it and my girlfriend bought me a Nest Hub Max for my birthday.

New Home Build - Diving back into automation,"Hello all,

The wife and I are building our first house and I want to dive deeper into home automation like I used to be a few years back in our current house. I used to have HomeSeer running on a server in my house tied to a GE Concord 4 Security system roughly 8 years ago. Currently, we have a bunch of smart wifi devices (smart bulbs, and receptacles) which are cloud based and also a bunch of Google Home speakers. Picked the majority of them up from a local wholesale/discount store. 

My primary automation objectives are as follows:

1. Smart Dimmer/Switch rockers in most rooms. Zwave or Caseta. Concerned about reliability and quality. Lot's of mixed opinions regarding z-wave switches (GE, Honeywell, Homeseer, Zooz). Lutron's Caseta looks to be top notch. 
2. Smart Speakers. I see HomeSeer allows for direct voice control from Google Home. We'll reuse the ones we currently have.
3. Security System integration. Looking at the Qolsys IQ 2+. Found that the IQ and the HS server can be Primary/Secondary Zwave Controllers. May need to confirm/test this before diving in.
4. I'm sure there will be receptacles that need integrated as well. Possibly Zwave.
5. We are going to have a 1000ft long driveway. Plan on putting in a driveway sensor in the ground and tie that into HomeSeer to trigger lights to turn on. Google TTS/Push Notification HS4.
6. Motion Devices for different light triggers.
7. Flood light integration for outside. If security system is tripped (in alarm) turn on all outside lights.
8. Some sort of HVAC integration. House will have a ClimateMaster or Bosch geothermal. Need to figure out the integration point. Modbus will be available. 
9. Future Sprinkler support via HomeSeer. Probably will do this via Modbus as well using a cheap PLC. 
10. Door locks on exterior doors will be Schlage FE599NX Z-Wave. Deadbolts where applicable to be Schlage Z-Wave. 

I need some help narrowing down a few items:

1. Im 90% sure that I want HomeSeer to be the main automation engine. Highly considering purchasing the HomeTroller PRO for a standalone device. Any concerns with the HomeTroller handling the item's above. 
2. I am really nervous to purchase 20-30 zwave or caseta switches. Having no experience with them; I am worried about reliability. It seems there is a lot of failures of the zwave type shortly after the warranty expiration. I know the caseta switches require a pro hub. Thoughts regarding reliability and us leaning towards caseta??
3. For flood lights. I like motion's, but also the ability to force them on/off. Is the best bet to use z-wave for this? I also like the flood lights that are always on but dim when no motion.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-23 04:04:05,New Home Build - Diving back into automation,"Hello all,  The wife and I are building our first house and I want to dive deeper into home automation like I used to be a few years back in our current house.

Debugging deconz,"I have some problems with my Deconz setup with lights reacting very slowly to turning on/off commands. This happens when using battery operated switches and apps (Home Assistant/Phoscon/Hue Essentials)

&amp;#x200B;

**My setup:**

\- RaspBee connected to a Raspberry 3B+ in my living room (central in my appartment and very close to several lightbulbs), Deconz Addon in Home Assistant, firmware is up to date ( 26390500 )

\- 16 device which can act as routers (bulbs, lightstrips, drivers...) from Hue, Tradfri, Gledopto, Müller tint, Osram

\- 26 battery powered devices (Aqara switches, Aqara motion sensors, Aqara tempereature sensors, 1 Hue motion sensor, 2 Hue remotes, 2 tradfri remotes

\- only 2 lights are controlled by a remote group in deconz (hue, tradfri remote), these usually respond quickly to presses

\- as the Aqara switches don't support remote groups they are controlled through node red or via rules  (button events) written to deconz using Hue Essentials toggling the lights on button presses

&amp;#x200B;

**Problems:**

\- sometimes lights react very slow (usually between milliseconds to 3seconds, seldom ots up to 10)

\- some messages seem to get lost completely

\- some messages need that long that we press a button twice, then both arrive shortly one after another so the light toggles twice

\- here is my deconz view:

I put a commercial building automation system in my new house.,"I'm hoping this can stay here.  I see a lot of folks trying to cobble together many different technologies in this sub reddit, in an effort to do some pretty cool stuff.  But its stuff that in the commercial Building Automation world, that would be dead simple and just the start.  Unfortunately those abilities come at a price, and work with things almost never found in your house. In other words, it can be really expensive.

Full disclosure, I am a Building Automation Systems contractor, and I have been in the business for over 23 years.  I am keeping this post vendor/brand neutral as possible, as I do sell and install these types of systems for a living, and it seems like promoting one of those here would be in bad faith.   Truth is, that all the major manufacturers have similar capabilities.   I also have never even looked at anything like home kit, as the current state of home automation me to be a tedious, half assed mess.  I did do some lights in the past with a Mi Casa verda Vera Zwave controller, but I gotta say i was not impressed.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I own a small farm that had a 100 year old farmhouse, that unfortunately had fatal structural flaws.  Since it was coming down with or without our help, we decided to tear it down and build a new one.

After a couple of decades in Energy Management, HVAC, and Project development and management, I decided that I would put a commercial grade Building Automation system.  Installing a system like this would probably cost around $30K retail, but remember I am a dealer so the parts I got at wholesale, and I did a lot of the work myself.  I have not added up what I spent, as its hard to cleanly  separate all the costs.

I also insisted on some commercial concepts with the HVAC system mostly, and some electrical.

My builder was completely on board with this.  His HVAC contractor was not.  I should have fired him several times.  He was an idiot, and I work with loads of commercial mechanical contractors that would have cut me a nice deal to do my house.  But the builder wanted to use ""his guy"".   He also wanted to use his electricians, but I fired them three days in for very good reasons.  I was able to bring in my own contractor that had a full understanding of what I was trying to accomplish.

Anyway, the thing with the HVAC system that blew the contractors mind is that I ducted the heat pumps  together and used zone dampers to be able to send the heating or cooling from any heat pump to any part of the house.    This has several advantages.  Since I have two different sized heat pumps, I can match the most appropriate heat pump to the load. I also can equalize the run time they accumulate. Most importantly, if one dies, I do not lose heating or cooling to any part of the house.

I put a hot water heating coil in the common supply as well.  I have a combi boiler that does both my hot water and also has a heating loop that I can trigger with my system.   I have full control of both the hot water recirc loop and the heating loop.

The electric strip heat for the heat pumps is still there in case all else fails. I hope to never use it.

My house is divided into four zones, that have modulating dampers.    In commercial buildings this type of system is referred to as a ""VVT""  or a pressure dependent system.  Pressure dependent systems  are old technology, and quite frankly are not really installed that much anymore for good reason.   They are however cheap, and for my house, it was a good application.    The system keeps track of the active set point in the space and adjusts to keep the temperature stable in the zone.  The system keeps track of the zone needs and responds appropriately to keep both the zones and the heat pumps happy.

I used flow, temperature, and humidity sensors to calculate the realtime BTU performance of the heat pumps, and to alert me by text when one starts to slip too far.

I have six ""sensor nests"" through out the house that can tell me all kinds of things including temperature, humidity, light levels, sound levels, and occupancy. They also have RGB light rings that I can use to have the system communicate status or anything else I want.  In addition, there are two touch space temperature sensors that users can use to interact and display suystem info, as well as a larger touchscreen in the kitchen.

The screen shots in the imgur link show a web based interface that is actually hosted by my company, so that I can access the system from anywhere.

There are four programmable controllers (DDC) in the system, that communicate using a standard called BACnet. (ASHRAE 135 if you're really bored.)  BACnet is a very popular communications protocol in the industry.

What's not shown?  I have two doors with fingerprint readers so that I and my family are never locked out.  I'm registering some trusted friend as well, with the caveat that the system will log them using their fingerprint to enter, and it will text me immediately when they do.   I also have an Enocean wireless  hub, to do lighting controls next.

I see a lot of folks trying to cobble together many different technologies in this sub reddit, in an effort to do some pretty cool stuff.  But its stuff that in the commercial Building Automation world, that would be dead simple and just the start.  Unfortunately those abilities come at a price, and work with things almost never found in your house. In other words, it can be really expensive.  Full disclosure, I am a Building Automation Systems contractor, and I have been in the business for over 23 years.  I am keeping this post vendor/brand neutral as possible, as I do sell and install these types of systems for a living, and it seems like promoting one of those here would be in bad faith.   Truth is, that all the major manufacturers have similar capabilities.   I also have never even looked at anything like home kit, as the current state of home automation me to be a tedious, half assed mess.  I did do some lights in the past with a Mi Casa verda Vera Zwave controller, but I gotta say i was not impressed.  [Imgur Link]   ​  My wife and I own a small farm that had a 100 year old farmhouse, that unfortunately had fatal structural flaws.  Since it was coming down with or without our help, we decided to tear it down and build a new one.  After a couple of decades in Energy Management, HVAC, and Project development and management, I decided that I would put a commercial grade Building Automation system.  Installing a system like this would probably cost around $30K retail, but remember I am a dealer so the parts I got at wholesale, and I did a lot of the work myself.  I have not added up what I spent, as its hard to cleanly  separate all the costs.  I also insisted on some commercial concepts with the HVAC system mostly, and some electrical.  My builder was completely on board with this.  His HVAC contractor was not.  I should have fired him several times.  He was an idiot, and I work with loads of commercial mechanical contractors that would have cut me a nice deal to do my house.  But the builder wanted to use ""his guy"".   He also wanted to use his electricians, but I fired them three days in for very good reasons.  I was able to bring in my own contractor that had a full understanding of what I was trying to accomplish.  Anyway, the thing with the HVAC system that blew the contractors mind is that I ducted the heat pumps  together and used zone dampers to be able to send the heating or cooling from any heat pump to any part of the house.    This has several advantages.  Since I have two different sized heat pumps, I can match the most appropriate heat pump to the load. I also can equalize the run time they accumulate. Most importantly, if one dies, I do not lose heating or cooling to any part of the house.  I put a hot water heating coil in the common supply as well.  I have a combi boiler that does both my hot water and also has a heating loop that I can trigger with my system.   I have full control of both the hot water recirc loop and the heating loop.  The electric strip heat for the heat pumps is still there in case all else fails. I hope to never use it.  My house is divided into four zones, that have modulating dampers.    In commercial buildings this type of system is referred to as a ""VVT""  or a pressure dependent system.  Pressure dependent systems  are old technology, and quite frankly are not really installed that much anymore for good reason.   They are however cheap, and for my house, it was a good application.    The system keeps track of the active set point in the space and adjusts to keep the temperature stable in the zone.  The system keeps track of the zone needs and responds appropriately to keep both the zones and the heat pumps happy.  I used flow, temperature, and humidity sensors to calculate the realtime BTU performance of the heat pumps, and to alert me by text when one starts to slip too far.  I have six ""sensor nests"" through out the house that can tell me all kinds of things including temperature, humidity, light levels, sound levels, and occupancy.

Control your Apple TV using Automations &amp; Timers,"Well this is for us the parents who have Kids in particular and who have overtaken the Living Room and at times they don’t even go to bed when they have to.

PoE / Ethernet Wall Switch That Sends UDP Packets?,"I am looking for a wall switch with 2+ buttons that is powered by PoE and sends unique UDP packets over Ethernet. The packets could be sent to a specific IP address or just broadcasted. For example, if someone pressed button one, it would send a packet over IP to a device to turn lights on. If they press button two it would turn lights off. (Btw, I’m only looking for the wall switch.)
Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Which Wi-Fi system should i go with (bought eero but having issues)?,"I wanted to upgrade to a mesh system. My 'old' router (Asus RT-AC86U) (connected to a Verizon Fios modem/router) is great but we have some weaker spots in the house- not bad considering our house is 3,800 sq feet. I have it set up that the Verizon router is for guests and then my connected router is for my wife, myself, and all my gadgets (too many to list but it includes the pool, smart shower, cameras, garage door, deadbolts, some lights, speakers, generator, etc).

I switched to the Eero 6 (not the pro). And I don't love it. My pool cannot connect to it, had to connect that to the Verizon router. Same with my shower. My surface book laptop had a ton of issues for 24 hours but it's seemed to stop now.

I can go with the Netgear Orbi 3 pack from Costco for $70 off making it $429, or maybe I shouldn't go mesh and just get a TP-Link archer 11000, also Costco, for $100 off making it $299. Yes, I wanna go with Costco for a reason...I just returned an 18 month old Sonos soundbar to upgrade to the Sonos Arc, and they took it back! I love that I can future proof by returning if necessary. 

Oh, and I'm not a gamer, but am looking at getting the Nintendo Switch for my wife (she misses Dr. Mario and all those old school games). My oldest of 3 is only 5, so they aren't online (yet).

Have a bit of an odd use case for a smart thermostat.,"As winter is coming up, I’m looking to close up the underside of a camper I have permanently parked at some property.

It has access to WiFi and electric 24/7 so no worries there.

Basically what I would like is to have a thermostat in the crawl space under the camper that can activate a heater under the camper when the temperature drops bellow a certain point and turn it off when it gets high enough. 

Also ideally, I would like to be able to have power permanently running to the thermostat, but be able to switch the power to the heater on and off. Any advice on what to look for would be appreciated.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-21 16:33:30,Have a bit of an odd use case for a smart thermostat.,"As winter is coming up, I’m looking to close up the underside of a camper I have permanently parked at some property.

Need help choosing a robot vacuum cleaner,"My mom decided she wants a new robot vacuum cleaner. She wants one that is relatively quiet ~60db and that also has the mopping function.

I disagree because that's usually just a gimmick to get you to buy on a _discount_ and also I've never heard of this company so I don't know how good they are.

Shelly rgbw2 not retaining setting,"I recenty bought a Shelly RGBW2 to control my rgbw lightstrip. As this is the only smart device I have I don't have a Home Assistant server or something and because it's more repsonsive I control the Shelly with Tasker directly, sending HTTP requests when I want to change brightness/colour.

It works great, just what I wanted, but when sending a request to turn on just the RGB part of the strip and at low brightness (just the red channel at 10% brightness for example) the lights stay on for about 30 seconds to 1 minute and then turn off (or change to last valid setting, I guess. The Shelly is set to return to last state when losing power. This makes me think that the Shelly restarts after receiving the HTTP command. I shoul probably note that when this happens the local Shelly address becomes unresponsive).

Checking on the local shelly address, when setting high brightness via HTTP request the sliders change on the site, but on lower brightness they don't. This problem is solved by doing a factory reset but comes back after 14 days or so. 

Does anyone have any idea why this would be happening? Could it be a power supply issue or is the Shelly configured wrong, somehow?

Help with smart bulbs,"
I have Phillips wiz led smart bulbs and they will not connect to my 2.4g network. I have tried seemingly everything and they won’t work. If I use another phone to set up a personal hotspot I can connect them just fine. I’ve moved them within inches of the router, tried manual pairing, changed ssid names, etc..

I have an arris surfboard router that supposedly uses both 2.4 and 5g and I’ve verified my phone was connected to the 2.4 before attempting to pair the bulbs.

Smart Curtains/blinds help?,"Hey guys, I'm starting to look into curtains and blinds, there are a lot of options so I'm a little confused, doesn't help that I have no experience in traditional curtains and blinds, let alone smart ones... so I'm wondering what the order of installation is?

For curtains I'd like to have day (sheer) curtains + a night curtain to actually block out the sun if needed.  


For smarts, I'd like to control both with Alexa (IE: Alexa open day curtains/night curtains) and preferably be able to set a schedule for automated opening/closings.

Best contact and motion sensors for home assistant?,"Looking for the best (cheap) motions sensors and (7) contact sensors that work with home assistant. I currently have a pretty small smart home set up, but I'm looking to expand. 

Right now I have an Ikea tradfri set up, with a few bulbs, gateway and remote. I also have a bunch of wifi enabled plugs, a switch, and led strips (Kasa, or Tuya compatible). I have some Wyze products as well, including a couple cameras and the scale. I do have several Alexa based devices including the echo plus (which I'm using as a zigbee hub), I haven't attempted to add into home assistant yet, but it's on the list. Attached to the plus I have 3 hue bulbs, but I'm looking to switch everything over to a cheaper alternative, most likely ikea or wyze (or if you have another suggestion). My wyze products are not attached to home assistant either at this point (also on my to-do list.)

So should I go with sensors from Ikea or Wyze, or should I go with a cheaper aliexpress alternative? My ultimate goal is to create a 100% automated light system. Especially at night, I'd like the lights to turn on from the hallway to the bathroom at only a fraction of their brightness. I'd also like everything to go off if no one is home or in the room.

Hue - Any way to make smart lights less dumb? How to automate ‘away state’ without geofencing?,"Hi guys, I just got my first few Hue bulbs and a Hue bridge and thought it’d be smooth sailing from here.

With me, my wife, parents, in-laws and potential babysitters, it’s an awful lot of phones to keep maintained/installed. Are there any other ways to do this? 

I am quite confident I could trigger an IFTTT via a SmartThings plug in combination with my home alarm’s proprietary smart plug, but IFTTT doesn’t have any appropriate actions. So I’m running out of ideas. Has anyone tried anything similar?

Also, living in a house I want so start some lights based on the fact that I’m not home (and things like the HueLabs ‘TV mimicking’), while the Hue app only seem happy to turn things off... strange to me. I suppose I could solve this via iconnect hue, but then I’m back on geofencing.

Thanks guys!",Hue  Any way to make smart lights less dumb How to automate ‘away state’ without geofencing Hi guys I just got my first few Hue bulbs and a Hue bridge and thought it’d be smooth sailing from here Turns out the Hue Bridge doesn’t seem that powerful as I was led to believe I’ve been playing around how to set up my ‘away’ but I do not really appreciate geofencing With me my wife parents in-laws and potential babysitters it’s an awful lot of phones to keep maintained/installed Are there any other ways to do this I am quite confident I could trigger an IFTTT via a SmartThings plug in combination with my home alarm’s proprietary smart plug but IFTTT doesn’t have any appropriate actions So I’m running out of ideas Has anyone tried anything similar Also living in a house I want so start some lights based on the fact that I’m not home and things like the HueLabs ‘TV mimicking’ while the Hue app only seem happy to turn things off strange to me I suppose I could solve this via iconnect hue but then I’m back on geofencing Can any of you home automation folks shed some lights on how to actually make things automated Thanks guys

Finding automated outdoor shades?,"I have a very small (550sq.ft.) condo, and ~ 20 linear feet of sliding glass patio.

Is anyone familiar with blackout / other shade setups that work being installed outside (covered patio, wind rarely but can really pick up)?

I have an automated projection screen inside that lowers down I front of a 100"" wide section of patio, but unfortunately that does not black out light from the city.  The projection screen housing takes up the space where an indoor shade would otherwise fit.

Connectors for LED strips,"Hi all,

I recently bought some Osram Led strips and I 90° connectors to place them where I need them to be.

The only things I find need me to cut the silicon to do the connections and it's not the easiest part especially because those Osram have a very thin layer of ""paper"" with the ""wires"" in it.

Isn't there any male-female connector ?

Or is there a way to easily remove the silicon 

Thanks !",r/homeautomation,2020-11-20 20:12:16,Connectors for LED strips,"Hi all,  I recently bought some Osram Led strips and I 90° connectors to place them where I need them to be.

I have both a SmartThings hub and a Hubitat hub en route. Which should I keep?,"Like the title implies, I keep changing my mind about this stuff. Ordered the Hubitat, but then changed my mind and ordered the Smartthings hub. Waffling again. Both arrive this weekend. Which one should I return?

Home automation setup is soon to be about 10-15 zwave Inovelli switches (also en route), and a few Hue and Ikea lights I inherited from a failed Christmas present to my parents (already running, but need the new hub to pair with the wall switches). Also pondering a smart thermostat, and a video doorbell.

Hubitat is attractive because it's off the cloud, and... The most... flexible?... maybe?

SmartThings is attractive because it's more user friendly and straight forward to setup?... Maybe?...

Has Hubitat improved it's UI since it was first released? Is Samsung's UI actually any better?

How do either fair with things like video doorbells and thermostats (or should I leave that to my voice assistant?)?

Any compatibility pitfalls for either I should be aware of?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-20 08:46:10,I have both a SmartThings hub and a Hubitat hub en route.

Can these wires be used on RGB Strips?,"Looking to build an Infinity Cube, but i need to cut the strips into two different piece for two sides on the cube.

Z-Wave / Homeassistant | Aotec USB stick and Multisensor won't connect,"Hi there,

I'm not new to Homeassistant but I am new to Z-Wave. I have a Aeotec Gen5 USB stick which is found fine by my Homeassistant docker. To test my first Z-Wave device I also got a Aeotec Multisensor 6.

Now I follow the guidelines, I click the 'Add node' button, then I press the button on my Multisensor. The blue led starts blinking as it should, but after a few seconds it turns red indicating that it couldn't find a network.

I've already factory resetted the Multisensor, but that didn't help. Here's the log from Homeassistant:

Motion sensors... zigbee or z-wave?,"Up front, I have an established z-wave mesh with most rooms in the house having the GE z-wave or z-wave plus switches, fan controllers, and dimmers.

The basics--What's the best iPhone HA app? (And what UIs should be avoided at all costs?),"Bonus points if it also runs on Android &amp; MacOS.

I am a neophyte to home automation. Stuff I've got:

* Dropcam (I stuck with it as it turned into Nest then Google Home).
* Nest thermostat. It wasn't the plan, but it came with the house.
* Wyze smart bulb (white tunable)
* Yeelight (color tunable)

I'm going to want lots of lighting. I might change the thermostat (I just don't like it). I may add more sensors. Probably smart switches and bulbs for sure. I'd like to be able to warm up the hot tub, do stuff if the garage door opens/close, do stuff around wake-up and beddy-by times.

The iPhone apps so far suck. Google's (consolidating all of the above) just ain't pretty. The stand alone apps for each device are okay, I suppose. Yeelight's is terrrible.

I want something that is great that I can us for everything even as I add more and more.

I don't ever want to use Alexa or talk to Siri in my home.

I have zero experience with Apple's HA stuff (though I am otherwise an Apple guy.)

While I'm considering Z-wave (and maybe HomeSeer, though I can be convinced to go another way), I *REALLY* want to make sure that whatever I do I can easily manage from my iPhone and spouse can do so from Android.

So, what are the great UIs and which ones should be avoided at all costs?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-20 03:26:43,The basics--What's the best iPhone HA app?

Is there a way to wirelessly sync 2 TV's to display the same image?,"I've seen this question asked a couple times, but never for wireless options. 

I'd like to add a Samsung TV Frame to my Kitchen area - mostly to display art 95% of the time. But I'm wondering if there's a way to have it play the same thing my TV in my living room is playing. A bit gluttonous I know, but I'd like the idea of cooking and moving between the kitchen / living room while seamlessly watching the same show / movie. 

I don't think there's an ideal way to connect the two with cables / an HDMI splitter, so I'm wondering if anyone knows of any wireless options to make this happen?

Re-use C4 amp with DIY solution?,"I've bought a house that had a legacy Control4 configuration, and I'm not interested in over-paying to upgrade the hardware or pay someone else to have access to my network and devices.

To convert to DIY, one of the pieces I need to solve for is my C4-16amp3-b amp, which is an 8-zone amplifier ([https://www.control4.com/docs/product/4-zone-matrix-amplifier/data-sheet/english/revision/B/4-zone-matrix-amplifier-data-sheet-rev-b.pdf](https://www.control4.com/docs/product/4-zone-matrix-amplifier/data-sheet/english/revision/B/4-zone-matrix-amplifier-data-sheet-rev-b.pdf)).

Aside from this abandoned repository I found on Github, which has conf files for OpenHab + C4 tuner/amp, I was wondering if anyone knew of the best solution to re-use the amp? I don't care much \*what\* the solution is (whether OpenHab, Home-Assistant, etc), just what options people know of.

My expectation is that the amp is a mostly dumb piece of equipment, meaning it shouldn't need access to C4 software/network to operate. Has anyone any experience with this, and is it worth whatever effort is required?

Questions concerning switching from Smarthings to Home Assistant.,"Looking for some insight on switching over a semi complex home automation setup from SmartThings  over to Home Assistant.  I currently have about 60 entities on my SmartThings setup, lights, light controllers, outlets, relays, wall switches, motion sensors, etc.  I also have Google Home integrated with thermostats, cameras and speakers throughout the house.  Currently the integrations work well and voice control is pretty smooth.

One of my main issues is that I have spotty Internet and SmartThings doesn't work well when I lose connection so I have been looking into Home Assistant for more local control.  I have been playing around with it for a couple of weeks trying to learn how to setup the dashboards, integrations and so on.  Long term I plan to get rid of Google as well but that is another issue I will deal with down the road. 

I purchased a  HUSBZB-1 zigbee/zwave controller to control my devices but have a few questions.  Right now I am not comfortable switching over completely as I am still a novice with Home Assistant, however I would like to start adding new devices directly instead of through SmartThings.  Can I add zigbee devices to the  HUSBZB-1 without creating issues with SmartThings zibee radio?  I understand Zwave is a little more complicated due to exclusions but am fine waiting a bit for that.  My WiFi is pretty stable even without Internet so I don't want to add a lot of unnecessary inference if it wont integrate properly.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-19 17:40:42,Questions concerning switching from Smarthings to Home Assistant.,"Looking for some insight on switching over a semi complex home automation setup from SmartThings  over to Home Assistant.

Soil temperature sensors?,"I'm baffled by the lack of options. I can find plenty of sensors to tell me the moisture level in the soil. I want the actual temperature. 

This determines when to apply pre-emergents, fertilizers, grass seed etc. 

In a perfect world, I'd have a sensor in the shade, and one out in the sun burried \~5 inches under the grass and far enough away from the house to avoid skewing the results. I'd have push notifications at a few specific temperature settings and the ability to import the data logs so I can build historical trends in Excel. 

Currently, I have concocted a  plan to simply take a cheap Govee sensor and place it in a 'stash can' meant for divers. It's the smallest, cheapest, waterproof container I could find that isn't metal and big enough to work. Any empty space would impact accuracy so I'm thinking I can just fill that space with dry play sand. The whole works then gets buried in the yard.

How to control 868 Mhz RF devices from Homebridge or HomeAssistant?,"We have 14 blinds which are controlled by remotes. I would like to get them to work with either Homebridge or Home Assistant. We currently have HB working nicely with other devices, but are considering HA as it seems a lot more capable and flexible.

I originally thought the blinds might be running on 433 MHz, so tried out a Broadlink RM4 Pro, but it didn't work.

Using an RTL-SDR USB device, I've established that they are communicating via 868 MHz. I also know that the blinds are able to communicate back their current status, so the traffic must be two-way. (I don't imagine they are using rolling codes as they wouldn't pose a security threat.)

I could do all the RF hacker stuff and build myself a Pi-based thing to replicate the conversations, then write a HB plugin for it, but if there is another solution I would prefer not to reinvent the wheel.

Does anyone know if there's an RF-learnable or -configurable device available that works with HB or HA that can help me achieve this?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-19 16:10:22,How to control 868 Mhz RF devices from Homebridge or HomeAssistant?,"We have 14 blinds which are controlled by remotes.

GE/Jasco Z-Wave dimmer not working,"So I'm not sure if this is the correct sub, since is more electrical related but I'll give it a shot.  
I got a GE/Jasco Z-Wave Plus dimmer model 47338, I connected to my Hubitat hub, no issue so far.  I can see the dimmer changing status and level. I don't have a dimmable bulb on hand so I tried first with an incandescent bulb (these are supposed to be dimmable) but the bulb didn't even turn on (the state was changing in the Hubitat device page), then I tried with a led bulb, it is not dimmable but at least it should work with on/off. This is the opposite of the incandescent bulb, with the led switch it turns on and it stays like that. I tried to power off but it does not work. 

After more debugging I measure the voltage in the switch with the led bulb and there is practically 0V difference, so the switch is on, circuit is closed and no way to turn it off, so it makes sense the bulb is on, even if in Hubitat shows as off.  
And whit the incandescent is the opposite, the switch remains off, the circuit is open. So I don't know what's the difference with the two bulb. Why with one bulb the switch is perpetually on and with other off? Should I try another bulb? I even try switching the line and neutral wires but the same happens.   
Has anybody seen this behavior with this or other switches?

Touchplate lighting control custom replacement,"I purchased a house in 2014 that had the old touch plate system still installed from 1950s.

The design I came up with works well and included internet connectivity for control via my smartphone.

I've not been able to find any third party that is done a touch plate replacement system  and was wondering if anyone else out there would be interested in a lower cost replacement system.

My zigbee sensor to WiFi bulb is too slow. Advice pls?,"I'm pretty new to this. My first project is to turn the bathroom light in when someone enters the room.

I'm running Home Assistant core, koenkk_zigbee2mqtt and eclipse_mosquitto as docker containers. I have a [cc2531 dongle](https://notenoughtech.com/news/get-cc2531-on-the-itead-store-instead/) with Zigbee2MQTT firmware. In terms of devices I have a TAPO wifi bulb and a Sonoff SNZB-03 zigbee motion sensor.

After some amount of effort, I got the bathroom light coming on as I came into the room. Success! Unfortunately, there's a two-second delay and that's enough time for someone to reach for the light switch, which will result in confusion.

I'm not sure where the delay is coming from. I'd guess the motion sensor rather than Home Assistant or the wifi bulb, but I might be wrong. At any rate, I'd like to try and reduce the two seconds. Would a door sensor be faster?

Advice appreciated.

Update 1: Swapping the Tapo bulb (uses cloud) for a Novastella bulb (flashed with Tasmota) reduced the time to 1.5seconds. I’m going to try another motion sensor.

Update 2: Swapping the Sonoff motion sensor for a Samsung SmartThings motion sensor reduced the time to about 0.2 seconds, so the Sonoff sensor was definitely the weak link. After this I swapped out my Zigbee USB and Zibgee2MQTT docker container and replaced them with a Tasmota-flashed Sonoff Bridge. It’s a slightly simpler system but the reaction times has crept up to about 0.5 seconds.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-18 22:20:40,My zigbee sensor to WiFi bulb is too slow.

Buttons - How to track one's medication,"Equipment: SmartThings Hub and SmartThings Button

Connections: IFTTT and Google Sheets

I take a lot of medication unfortunately and I have short-term memory issues with the mundane part of my life turning off the coffee maker, taking pills, etc. I wanted a simple button that I can press at my medicine cabinet every time I take my medication. I'm supposed to take six different meds in the morning, one at lunch, and four before bed of eight different meds. SmartThings button has the one press, double press, one long press, options for 3 different tasks. I wanted to use this button to accomplish the following tasks:

1) google sheet tracking when I take my medication. So when I take my meds and then two hours later I question whether or not I took them I could check the excel sheet to see if there is a timestamp in there. Missing a dose or overdosing is super problematic and can cause me to miss a day of work.

2) email myself that I need to request a refill. I kid you not... I sometimes will be down to my last pill before remembering to order more. 

3) email myself to set up a doctor's appt. 

When I go to set up the button in IFTTT, IFTTT doesn't recognize SmartThings button as a button nor does it have it as an option as ""pressing the button.""

Would any of you savvy folks be able to assist me in this matter to make things simpler with my medication?

Ideas on automating some kind of indicator so say I am in a meeting.,"The title pretty much sums it up. I am looking for ways to automate a light that shows I am in a meeting. That way my family will know if they can come in to my home office.

On automatic door closing...,"We all know and love (at least I do) self closing door hinges, like [these](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Self-Closing-3-5-Door-Hinge/dp/B07GF54QVJ/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=spring+hinges&amp;qid=1605753436&amp;sr=8-2). They're especially useful for exterior doors. But I have an idea to make these hinges even better...

Now for all I know, this device could already exist, but I haven't seen it anywhere. The device would essentially be a [door catcher](https://www.amazon.com/Amerock-143-Double-Roller-Catch/dp/B00313DA4G/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=door+catcher&amp;qid=1605754489&amp;sr=8-5) or an [automatic door holder](https://www.amazon.com/Rockwood-494-26D-Automatic-Clearance-Fasteners/dp/B009ZM1JMW/ref=sr_1_13?dchild=1&amp;keywords=automatic+door+holder&amp;qid=1605755198&amp;sr=8-13), but the catcher or holder would have the ability to release the spear when prompted through an app or connected home assistant, and the door would close via the self closing hinges.

This way, if you leave a door be, it is closed. If you wish for it to remain open, simply latch it so. If the door is open when you want it closed, but aren't in the door's vicinity, simply pull out your phone or ask your assistant to close it. Voila. I envision this would be more useful for interior doors.

I realize that this leaves out being able remotely OPEN a door, and that there are products on the market that will do this ALONG with closing the door, but they are quite the pretty penny.

Does anyone know of any such device? Is such a device plausible?

(RF433/RFlink)PIR sensor sometimes doesn’t transmit.,"I’m having an occasional problem with some PIR sensors I bought, occasionally they outright refuse to send a message when triggered although the led lights up. I’m using them with an RFLink Nodo box which is in turn connected to HomeAssistant on a Pi.


At the point I’m seeing failure, other RF433 devices are transmitting ok.
 

Now I admit they weren’t very expensive as these go, [around £4 each on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001070422027.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.6f0b4c4d86EJpv) but their range is very good and have an extendable antenna on each one - I confirmed it’s connected to the PCB electrically and not just there for show. I bought these to replace some Sonoff PIR sensors which exhibited the same behaviour.

 I’m just wondering if there could be any other reason for the occasional lack of RF than just  “cheap crap” and maybe a way to troubleshoot further.

Also, if anyone has a link to more expensive but known to be reliable PIR RF433 units it’d come in useful.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-19 02:43:05,(RF433/RFlink)PIR sensor sometimes doesn’t transmit.,"I’m having an occasional problem with some PIR sensors I bought, occasionally they outright refuse to send a message when triggered although the led lights up.

Favorite Smart Plugs?,"Hi All,

I also have an abode home security system that allows me to control devices using Z-Wave. Ideally, this is what I would use, to avoid connecting to more and more different apps, but again, i'm not attached.

New Construction Wiring Consolidation Question,"I am building a new home and have the opportunity to plan out all of my LV wiring needs.  I've been learning a significant amount of information regarding LV wiring &amp; automation (thanks to this community) and so I've gone a bit overboard on my initial plans, or so I think.  My home will be approximately 5,000 square feet including the basement though not including a 3rd floor livable attic.  Right now I am at about 171 wiring points which include all home audio, video, security and other automation interests.  I included a picture that illustrates my wiring plans by room along with the first floor depicted.  In general, I am concerned wiring costs alone (cable and labor) is going to cost me upward of $20,000 though recognize this is a one-time opportunity to get the infrastructure done correctly.

My main questions below are related to finding opportunities to consolidate and/or reduce the number of wires in my current plans without compromising capability, but I also had a couple related question on Touchscreens and Soundbar vs. In-ceiling speakers.

1. Should I include Cat6 runs for both Voice Enabled Devices (e.g., Amazon dots in the ceiling) and Touchscreens or should I simply plan to have Touchscreens that support voice enabled commands thereby reducing Cat6 runs in the ceiling?
2. Similar to the question above, should I include wiring for sensors or are there touchscreens available that support sensing/motion and thereby reduce the need for separate motion sensors throughout the house?
3. Have I gone completely overboard?  Have I overlooked anything?
4. What Touchscreens provide the greatest user experience and flexibility (e.g., ability to control lighting, audio, etc.) while also having nice aesthetics.  I have been looking at different manufactured touchscreens (e.g., Savant) but I'm not sure I want to subject myself to a particular manufacturer and some lack flexibility.  For example, I really like HTD's Lync12 system, but I'm not crazy about their keypads since they are limited to audio only.  I am thinking the best and most flexible solution is to have wall-mounted iPad / Android devices that are running Home Assistant but curious how these devices will behave when they are not in use.  Can I configure iPads / Android devices to run Home Assistant by default (avoid the user from having to start the application) and do they wake up automatically when they sense nearby motion?  Ideally I want these devices defaulting to the application and making it easy for the end-user to adjust lights, play music, or control audio.  I also think iPads on the wall look bulky!
5. In my family room I am leaning towards a soundbar + 2 in-ceiling speaker setup primarily to enhance the TV/movie watching experience (direct sound from the TV area vs. sound coming the ceiling), though will it impact the audio listening experience when I want to simply have audio throughout the entire house (i.e., does audio coming from a hybrid combination of a soundbar and in-ceiling speakers feel awkward?).

I plan to automate majorly using Home Assistant and/or Homekit, I have some two way switches and some normal. Mostly lights but a couple of fans. Below are my constraints sorted in priority order:

1. Not too expensive but willing to spend for less maintenance and longer life

Need help choosing a thermostat,"I want to automatize the heating in my house and for that I was looking for a thermostat with some features:
I want to have routines (like at 6am put it at 25 degrees)
I need it to have a battery because my house isn't prepared for this

Mi Home Temp Sensor - Bluetooth playing up with Home assistant,"Hey everyone,

Recently I accidentally managed to brake my bluetooth dongle which I had the sensor working with previously thanks to help in a previous thread so I decided I'd get a proper WiFi/Bluetooth card for my computer to replace it.

Amazon Echo Show or DIY?,"Hi Guys,

I am new to the whole topic of home automation, so bear with me if there are any mistakes or inaccuracies. My first actual use-case is quite simple: I want a few smartplugs that I can turn of when I leave my appartment. So I did some research about the protocols and networks and ended up with the decision that I want to start with a Zigbee Hub and those smartplugs. This might be quite the overkill for my use-case but as you all probably understand: I want some room for further automation and this seems a reasonable base for it.

When I was looking for the options for a Zigbee Hub I stumbled upon the ""Conbee II""-Stick. I like this option because it's a fairly good price and doesn't force me into proprietary hard-/software as other gateways might do.

Furthermore I got into programming lately and thought about building some kind of weather station/smartmirror/info screen based on a raspberry pie.

You see where this is going: I am planning on fusioning this projects. But since I am still lacking the overview about both topics I am asking you guys for some help.

The options I want to decide between are:

a) Getting an Amazon Echo Show for around 200$ on Black Friday and use this as my Zigbee Hub.

* pros: 
   * it works and is comfortable
   * all the advantages and functions I get with an Echo
* cons:
   * I don't have any fun building it.

b) Building my own info tablet/weather station/zigbee hub by buying a raspberry, a screen for the rasp and the ConBee, which is also around 200$ and run Alexa on it.

* pros: 
   * I might have a lot of fun building it and will learn a lot from it
   * I can stick the Conbee in any other device and still have a working hub while I use the other hardware for any other purpose
* cons:

Sonoff or similar safe for in-wall/in-attic? Or other option for switchless lights.,"I'm trying to find a solution for a hallway. I'd like to install some ultra-slim recessed LEDs to give me some light but REALLY don't want to fish wire down the wall for a switch. These will be new lights with new wiring.

I'm trying to put the lights directly on a dimmer but barring that simple on/off would work.

It looks like my options now are something like the Sonoff but I've read some posts where people say they wouldn't trust them in-wall let alone left in an attic primarily due to the lack of UL/ETL listings.

The only other thing I could come up with would be wiring a smart dimmer/switch in the attic. I'm a little leery of that as well but much less so than an unlisted device. I would of course have it in a junction box not just strewn about.

Training smart thermostats to adhere to 'Time of Use' plans?,"My electricity provider (PG&amp;E) has been sending me marketing emails trying to make me switch to Time of use plans* along with an incentive for a smart thermostat.  The spiel (according to them) is that it'll reduce energy usage.

So the question here is:

* How easy is it to train Nest/Ecobee to behave like this?

* As I'm talking through this, I'm realizing that I actually don't need a thermostat that's smart.  I just need something that can adhere to certain schedules that I can set.  Any thermostat that allow these level of programming?  Obviously with Home Assistant, I'd be able to do this, but I don't know what brands allow a high level of integration.  I'd be happy to hear suggestions from fellow HA users.  My only criteria would be 1) integrates well with HA, 2) looks good so that it has a high WAF.

Video doorbell but with a twist,"Hi everyone, apologizes if this isn't the right sub for this.

I'm researching something for work, and it's left me scratching my head. Essentially, we have a front reception desk in our lobby, and normally, when the receptionist takes a lunch break, someone else comes down to cover the lunch shift. Well, with COVID, they don't want two people sharing a desk area (even not at the same time).

So, I've been tasked with finding a way for someone to ""virtually cover"" the front desk. Their initial idea was to setup an iPad running Zoom and have a visitor use that to call people upstairs. I'm not a fan of this for multiple reasons, including ease of use, powering the iPad, and securing it so it can't be stolen.

Off the top of my head, my initial idea was using a camera with 2-way audio, like an Arlo camera. But I also would like some kind of way for a visitor to ""request"" someone, like a button they could push. That's when I thought of a video doorbell. However, I'm running into an issue: it seems like all the video doorbells are made to wire into an existing doorbell spot on a porch. It looks like Arlo is coming out with a wire free one, but it's on pre-order.

**So my question is - is there a way to wire up a video doorbell to a standard wall outlet? Like some kind of an adapter?** Ideally I don't want to wait for the Arlo wire free doorbell to come out, and even if it was out, I'd rather wire something into an outlet instead of changing batteries all the time.

Or perhaps I'm even overthinking this - if anyone has another solution besides a video doorbell I'm all ears. Our budget for this is a few hundred dollars, let's just say $300-$450 range. **I would like a way for a visitor coming up to the reception desk to push some kind of button, and have that send a notification to people upstairs on PCs, who will then be able to have a conversation with this visitor at the reception while remaining at their PC**s (they have headsets). Ideally we would like to be able to see the visitor at the reception desk, but two-way audio is a must. The visitor at the reception desk does NOT need to be able to see our staff, only hear and talk to them.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-17 17:42:29,Video doorbell but with a twist,"Hi everyone, apologizes if this isn't the right sub for this.

WiFi Advice Needed. What tech do you use?,"Hello, I currently have a mesh Google Wifi system in my house. I have been sort of happy with it, but I could be happier. I have a two story house with a basement and have a puck  on each level. This may be overkill.  I believe I could get by with two access points. One in the basement where the office will be and one on the main level. 

The only things upstairs will be a few SmartTVs and cell phones. Sort of the same on the main level. We currently have our Alarm system on the main level but it can be relocated to the basement and I can add a wireless siren on the main level. 

In the basement, I have a few smart hubs, the alarm gateway and a NAS hardwired into a switch.

I have several Amazon Echos, smart tvs, smart hubs, etc. Probably 70 devices total that are connected to the Wifi/Hardwired. I dont have cat6 run anywhere in the house, but am not opposed to running it to have two hardwired APs. 

I would like to have three subnets. Main, Guest, IoT. I would like to wall off one port on a switch in order to  have my plugged in devices segregated and also be able to keep those on the same subnet as what is on the IoT wifi. I will have a piHole running on the network as well. What hardware would you recommend?

I have researched Ubiquity and thought that (2) [**UniFi nanoHD Access Point**](https://store.ui.com/products/unifi-nanohd-us) and (1) USW Flex Mini would do the trick. Any thoughts?

Finishing up on a large home remodel and want to add a whole home smart audio system,"My wife and I are finishing up a 4 month remodel on our new home and are finally adding the final, fun touches. 

What I’d like to do is have speakers in 3 different areas of my house, 1) living room 2) dining room and formal living room 3) back patio. I’d like to be able to play sound in them individually or in groups. 

Is there a cool digital in-wall device I can use to control all of this so I can avoid using a clunky audio receiver in a cabinet? Alexa devices have been recommended to me but I’m not real clear on how that setup would work. For what it’s worth I prefer Google over Amazon if that’s an option.

Beginner learning Home Assistant: how to tell the motion detector to stop if someone pressed the light switch,"Hi guys. Continuing with my slow learning process for dummies, I have now successfully integrated two Zigbee devices to my Home Assistant, which work marvelously and make me happy. A wireless switch that toggles on/off a lamp and a wireless motion detector that turns on the lamp when detecting motion and turns it off if no motion is detected for 5 minutes. This is awesome already but perhaps I'd like to try a step further now.

What I'd like to achieve now is: if the lamp gets turned off through pressing the switch, I'd like the motion detector to stop turning on the lamp for X minutes (let's say 30 minutes) when detecting motion. However if the lamp gets turned on though pressing the switch, the motion detector should continue to work normally and turn off the lamp if no motion is detected for 5 minutes.

I'm just starting, so I feel I'm not ready for code yet. I've created these automations with the automation menu, or whatever it's called (what shows up when you click on ""skip""). So, if you think it's possible, I'd like to do this with this menu for now and not with code.

I just want to understand the logic. Maybe what I should do is set a condition for the motion detector: ""only do what you do IF the wireless switch didn't turn off the lamp for the past 30 minutes"". Or something like this, but I have no idea how to do this.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-16 23:29:01,Beginner learning Home Assistant: how to tell the motion detector to stop if someone pressed the light switch,"Hi guys.

Smart switches with smart bulb,"I've been given confusing advice and need to hear from people who know what they're talking about.

I was all set to buy Lutron Caseta switches but was warned that very few RGB bulbs are compatible with them (or perhaps not compatible with the the recessed light cans Lutron recommends). But on investigation it looks like RGB bulbs are generally smart bulbs, and combining smart bulbs with smart switches isn't smart. 

At the moment, we're doing a remodel, all the walls are open, and we can install whatever smart switches and whatever recessed cans we like. **Is there a good smart-switch to combine with RGB bulb**s (i'm okay with controlling the color and warmth from a bulb app -- doesn't need to be done through the switch)?

Sadly, I haven't been able to figure this out online. I'm good at learning things, but also humble enough to recognize that I might not even know the right questions or search engine terms to do a proper investigation.

For the record, before the remodel, I used Alexa to talk to Smartthings to talk to Cooper Aspire switches, and some outlets, and some Sengled bulbs -(Sengled bulbs hooked up to non-smart switches) so I'm not a complete newbie, but definitely no expert",r/homeautomation,2020-11-17 00:52:48,Smart switches with smart bulb,"I've been given confusing advice and need to hear from people who know what they're talking about.

Automated Film Studio?,"I work for a university and I've been tasked to develop a dead-simple, small video studio while we have downtime during the pandemic (it wouldn't be available until it's safe, of course). I'm an absolute novice when it comes to home automation, but I've been impressed with what folks have accomplished on this sub. I'm curious if I would be able to automate certain aspects of the studio with an echo dot or google nest. This would ideally involve simple tasks like turning on the studio lights, camcorder, microphone, and signal processors with a single voice command. It would also be great if I can add limitations to the device so the students can't try to use the echo dot for any other purpose.

Bought a house! Need some insight.,"So I am definitely into home automation but not as intricate as most of you. My experience is “off brand” lighting and plug-in outlets that connect directly to WiFi. 

I am mainly looking for insight as to brands to use that won’t break the bank but work well. I did buy a Smartthings hub a few months ago with the assumption that most things are compatible with it, but I learned that was not the case. If I could utilize this, that would be great. I have looked on their website for compatibility but the list is long so I am overwhelmed by it. 

My concern is taking up too much of the WiFi bandwidth so I’m assuming universal hubs are important. 

I have multiple Alexa’s already so I would like to stick with that as much as possible but some cross compatibility with HomeKit would be nice. 

Also what I think would be really important would be products that can be controlled by switches/buttons so that my fiancé doesn’t always have to speak to Alexa and can just flip a switch. 

What I am looking for:
- Lighting (bulbs and strips)
- Outlets (built-in or plug-in)
- Security system
- Home monitoring system
- Speakers/sound system 
- Outdoor cameras
- Control panel
- Operating system
- Anything else you think is necessary 

Please note I am not super savvy (especially when it come to things like Raspberry Pi or other things where I have to “hack” the system).

RGB Ceiling Lighting with Wall Mounted Controller Panel,"Hello\~

My ideal setup would be to have a wall mounted touch panel that I could turn on the lights, change the color, and change preset scenes from in addition to using an app.  A bonus would be if I can integrate it to alexa and also turn on/off recessed smart lights im planning to install in the ceiling as but I'm not that worried about that.

Confused on what smart smoke and CO detectors,"I am doing a remodel on a ranch house with an attic and crawlspace in SC in the United States. I'd like to have smoke and CO detectors throughout the house and be able to tell which alarm is triggered. I'd like to have them hardwired and for the alarm to work on battery backup too. Ideally I'd prefer to avoid Nest. I have Home Assistant with a Aeotec Z-stick Gen5 (Z-wave) and CC2531 Dongle (Zigbee). I also have a SmartThings hub too.

It's just my wife and I and a small dog. We have 3 bedrooms on one side of the house with a short hallway. One bedroom has its own small full bathroom, which is where we sleep. Right outside of that bedroom on the outside is the packaged HVAC unit with gas heat. In the hallway is another small full bath. The hallways leads to the living room which is where the front door is. The den is also off the hallway, and the dining room is connected to the living room. The kitchen is an open space with a gas range and the den area. 

The dining room connects to the kitchen as well. From the kitchen is a short set of stairs to a large bedroom with a full bath (FROG). This room is above the garage. In the garage, you go down a few stairs and there is a laundry room with gas water heater, garage area, and workshop area. The workshop we plan to make a small guest bedroom eventually. All bedrooms will have beds and potential guests. Most bedrooms are 12-16 feet on each side, but the FROG is quite large running almost 24 feet long.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this and what to buy.

1. Is there an all-in-one integrated solution? If so, do you have ballpark cost? I couldn't easily see the cost for the few I found like the one from Climax I read about here.
1. Should I get separate smoke and CO detectors or combined? I've read conflicting things on if a CO2 detector is better mounted down low vs the ceiling.

Leviton 3-Way Smart Switch Help,"Trying to wire a 3-way switch with Leviton DZ15S-1BZ master switch and DD0SR-01Z coordinating switch.  About to give up thinking this may not be possible.

My lights look to be set up in an switch-end manner (lights wired in between the two switches) so I only have one wire feeding into the coordinating switch box.

I have found the following configurations of the coordinating switch get these end results.

1. No light from either switch / clicking noise when toggling either switch shows that there is communication between the 2.

* White = neutral terminal screw marked WH
* Black = Traveler terminal screws marked YL/RD

2.  Master switch turns lights on/off.  Coordinating switch does nothing.

* White = Line/Load terminal screw marked BK
* Red = Traveler terminal screw marked RD

If I wire in really any other manner this this, the master switch does not turn on or off the lights.

Wemo smart outlet high data usage?,"I've got 3 Wemo Mini Smart Plugs that are clients of 2 different Ubiquiti Unifi APs.

Running Deep Packet Inspection on the outlets' traffic doesn't really yield anything interesting, as it all appears to be HTTPS traffic. 

Can anybody explain why this is going on? I'm pretty sure they're not part of a botnet. Firmware is the latest available, as well. But why would a smart plug be using 1GB of data in a month? I do have remote access turned on for them-- would it be reporting back to Belkin THAT much?

What carpeting works best for a robo-vacuum?,"We're looking to recarpet our bedrooms &amp; living room. We're also picking up a couple robotic vacuums to keep with the basic upkeep (likely Roborock or Deebot).

New build home - Smart home NVR help,"So I have been doing my research on smart home stuff for a new build I am doing and am stuck on the camera part. I have experience with IP POE installs with an NVR. 

I am looking for 5 cameras outside and 3 cameras in the kids room. In our current house we currently use Wyze cams and they are easy for the purpose of watching the kids as a baby monitor. 

All I really want to accomplish with this new house is the ability to have POE hardwired outdoor cameras going to an NVR and 3 WiFi indoor cameras that could be separate from the NVR system for the kids rooms. The big thing I would like to do is have Alexa support where I can tell Alexa to “view outdoor cameras” and the NVR hdmi showing all cameras will load on my main TV in the living room. Or say view kids rooms and have the 3 kids room show on the TV.

Before picking one over the other, I'm wondering if there is something in the design of the smart switch that makes it safer than a smart relay (assuming that both of them have **only** the CE marking and that the wiring is performed correctly)? E.g. maybe the smart switch needs less space and isn't crammed so heat can be dissipated better.

&amp;#x200B;

If one is not safer than the other, and both of them have only the CE marking, is it unwise to buy either of them? My last (and I guess the safest) option is to get IKEA Tradfri smart lights along with their switches.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-16 15:37:03,Are smart switches inherently safer than smart relays or does safety completely depend on the design of each individual product?,"I posted [this thread] /) recently to find out if relays are a safe way to make dumb lights smart.  ​  Before picking one over the other, I'm wondering if there is something in the design of the smart switch that makes it safer than a smart relay (assuming that both of them have **only** the CE marking and that the wiring is performed correctly)?

Doorbell doesn’t chime inside?,"Installed a video door bell. Works well,  except it doesn’t make a mechanical audible noise in the home?

I had to put a chime adapter in the chime box. Unsure what that’s for.  But when the door bell rings, it only sends an alert to the phone. 

I was expecting the box to still chime/ring? Not everyone in my home has a smart phone. Sometimes I turn the ringer off.

Should I not invest in SmartThings now that Samsung isn’t making new hardware?,"I’m very new to the smart home/automation scene and I’m sort of just now at the point where I’m thinking about getting a hub.

Device status response time on Homeseer.,"Last year I jumped ship and moved from SmartThings to HS3. When setting up automations I had one that would trigger my bathroom fan if the lights were turned on. The automation failed because it took minutes for HS3 to detect the change in status on the light. I reached out to support and they said that Insteon (I think that’s who they said) was the only system that could do instantaneous status reporting. I decided that if HS3 could not detect status right away I would just move back to ST, which has no problem reporting quickly. 

Is there something I missed on HS3 or do y’all just wait 5 minutes after you turn on a light for your automations to start?

How to control the lights above bathroom mirror with rules?,"I have 5 lights above bathroom mirror. They are so bright and always wanted to replace them with low intensity and smart bulbs. I am thinking on achieving below,can some give an idea?

when I enter ( with motion sensor) I will turn on 3 lights, and there should be some trigger, based on which which next two lights should turn on. What are some ideas I can think of?

What I am thinking and my reasons

1. using a NFC trigger -- This will be a challenge when there are guests. I can explain them to use a trigger to turn on all, but adding NFC is a challenge
2. adding a temp switch -- I wanna use this as a last option. 
3. Make switches smart - currently I live in a rented place, so this is not an option.

Multi zone speaker selector,"I have 4 speaker zones in my house wired to a central location. I'm hoping to:

Any smart bulbs that ACTUALLY dim?,"I love dimming lights for watching movies and whatnot. I’ve owned the incandescent ones with the sliding switch previously and they worked great. Trouble is, I thought I would “upgrade” with some TP Link bulbs and they’ve been complete shit. Setting it to “1%” is probably 20% as bright as 100%, and WAY brighter than my old school incandescent lights could get. I looked at reviews and this seems to be a common problem among many LED dimmable lights. 

So, are there ANY LED bulbs that can actually properly dim across the full spectrum of on and off, where the lowest setting is so dim you can barely tell it’s on, just like incandescent dimmable bulbs have been able to do for the last 80+ years?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-15 23:38:06,Any smart bulbs that ACTUALLY dim?,"I love dimming lights for watching movies and whatnot.

Will a new switch help me?,"I have installed10+ Leviton Leviton DZ15S-1BZ around my home and had luck with the neutral wire being there and able to be used.

I came upon a 3-way switch scenario where it looks like my electrical is set up in a 'Line-Switch-Load-Switch' manner instead of the 'Line-Switch-Load-Switch' manner or something comparable.

What I've run in to is that the Coordinating Switch (Leviton DD0SR-01Z) only has one wire running into this eletrical box.

I've discovered that I can get the lights to turn on from both switches but I cannot get them to turn off.

I did this by hooking up the traveler wires and the common wire to the common terminal (instead of the ""neutral"" that the instructions state).  This is different from my other 3-way switches where the Coordinating Switch only requires that neutral connection and one traveler wire.

I believe my issue with only getting lights to turn on, but not off is due to the wiring of the Coordinating Switch.  Any thoughts on what can be done to get this to work?

This is different from my other 3-way switches where the Coordinating Switch only requires that neutral connection and one traveler wire.  I believe my issue with only getting lights to turn on, but not off is due to the wiring of the Coordinating Switch.  Any thoughts on what can be done to get this to work?  Would another switch that requires no neutral work better in this situation?",Will a new switch help me I have installed10 Leviton Leviton DZ15S-1BZ around my home and had luck with the neutral wire being there and able to be used I came upon a 3-way switch scenario where it looks like my electrical is set up in a Line-Switch-Load-Switch manner instead of the Line-Switch-Load-Switch manner or something comparable What I've run in to is that the Coordinating Switch Leviton DD0SR-01Z only has one wire running into this eletrical box I've discovered that I can get the lights to turn on from both switches but I cannot get them to turn off I did this by hooking up the traveler wires and the common wire to the common terminal instead of the neutral that the instructions state This is different from my other 3-way switches where the Coordinating Switch only requires that neutral connection and one traveler wire I believe my issue with only getting lights to turn on but not off is due to the wiring of the Coordinating Switch Any thoughts on what can be done to get this to work Would another switch that requires no neutral work better in this situation
Amcrest Camera and Home Assistant,"Hi guys

So I've been looking into cameras and I do love the Ubiquity G3 Pro, but i feel like these Amcrest are a bit better being that they're 8MP 4K. I'm wondering if they will work with Home Assistant and some kind of NVR i can spin up in a VM?

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C7W91YR/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_RgASFbQRRFPBN?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1

What are your thoughts and should i got for them or something else? I would like ubiquity because they even have a doorbell and I can just control cameras and AP's from one place, but i want to get your thoughts on it!

Whole Home Audio - 4 Sonos Amps vs 1 Multi Zone Amp + 1 Sonos Port,"Looking for some input on best whole home audio options.

Sonos is cool, but is not great for 4-5 zones of audio since you need 1 amp per zone.

Control basic space heater with nest thermostat?,"Our house has a nest thermostat, which drives a typical furnace. The winters are cold, but the house is large and we don't use all the rooms, so we keep the thermostat set fairly low.

However, what I am trying to figure out is if there is any way for me to drive a wifi smart switch based on the temperature of one of these. Example, if the sensor for bedroom one drops below 65, turn on the Bedroom1ElectricHeater. From what I see, nest doesn't allow these integrations anymore, but I wonder if you creative folks have any work arounds or other suggestions?

So many choices out there...where to begin?,"We bought our house in March and I knew not a single thing about home automation and had no smart devices. I've read over the sticky and this sub is amazing. Thank you in advance! We now have:

2x Nest Learning Thermostats ($50 each from PSEG I couldn't pass up)

7x Smart plugs from Amazon and Treatlife (Office workstations, UV Filters for HVAC, plug in lamps etc...)

5x Echo Dots

1x Envisalink EVL4 (alarm system) - no smart/touchscreen keypad just 3x 6160's and 1x 6160RF and a new Vista 20-P panel

3x Smart light bulbs from LIFX and Sengled (these are used for our nightstands and a hallway light so we don't trip)

4x Blink Outdoor Cameras and 2x Indoor - I hate the outside ones and they are going back as soon as I have replacements.

Wants:

\- Motion sensor that turns on all my existing outside lights (4 different lights on one switch), I can hardwire but don't know if this exists. Essentially I want motion outside to turn an inside switch on AND still be able to still use the switch from inside. My driveway is a culdesac so 2 motion sensors would be ideal depending on which way someone drives in.  I don't want these running all day, just when we want it to or when there is motion. I tried a few smart bulbs, but you still have to remember to tell Alexa to turn on the lights as you drive up. This part of the house is old and has no neutral in the junction box. Ideally, this would also send me an alert somehow but not important.

\- I would also like to automate my indoor lights. I have 50ish high-hat/can lights throughout the house. The first thing I did when I moved in replaced each one with LED's so I don't want to replace the bulbs as I already dropped a few hundred $. I would be willing to replace the hardwired switches but want to pick a brand that works with my other stuff. 

\- Some kind of way to disarm the Envisalink besides using our phones. I always forget until we are already parked in the detached garage. I could add a keyfob but this seems like dated technology. I would also be willing to swap the Envisalink with something else. I rather enjoy tinkering with the alarm system.

\- NVR system with 6-8 cameras (I'm looking at Reolink but can be sold on others). I just ran a bunch of new outlets to a closet with my modem/router and will be dedicated to all these electronics. I can also put a hub or 2 in there if needed. I have a router satellite in my detached garage which I will use for POE for the cameras. The cameras attached to the house will run from closet NVR to attic down the eaves. A few hours worth of work but only have to do it once!

\- This is not as important, but a sensor that would turn on a plug or outlet when the HVAC fan goes on. I don't like the UV lights running 24/7 as the bulbs are expensive. I've seen someone set up a piece of paper that flaps inside the ductwork with a smartthings motion sensor that then triggers a plug/strip. I would go down this route if you think I could get use out of the smartthings hub for other wants.

Asking here since I don’t think Hubitat will be my limitation.   Thanks!    ",New Dishwasher can this be automated New dishwasher is coming soon so I still have access to the outlet behind it I know it’s a quiet dishwasher but is there some way I could automate when the dishwasher runs For example set it so that it runs at 2AM on Sunday Wednesday Friday or whatever I’m not sure that adding a smart outlet will help it can turn the power on at the desired time but I don’t think it will make the dishwasher run Any thoughts I have Hubitat Zigbee and Zwave Asking here since I don’t think Hubitat will be my limitation Thanks

Connecting SMD5050 leds,"I bought SMD5050 RGBWW led strips,2x5m with 60led/m. 

To power this 600 leds I need around 150W power supply. What with the controller? I look for WiFi option now (ZigBee to come). I found some controllers online, those usually say 4/5A per channel. So 4*5*12=240W, shall I change the power supply to 250W?

Can I connect in parallel those two strips to such controller?

Shall I gift a robot vacuum for my parents?,"Hey,

Since Christmas is coming and my parents are not getting younger I'd like to give them a Robot vacuum to make their life easier. However I'm not sure if it's gonna help or not:

At home the floor in general only tile or wooden floor, with some exception of  small rugs. The arrangement of the furniture is hectic and not always consistent so I'm not sure if a robot could handle the situation well enough or not. (Same for small rugs)

My budget would be around 300 EUR max, not sure if I can get anything good for this price or not. (I was looking at Xiaomi ones mostly which are fitting in this budget)

Any concerns about Aqara/Xiaomi devices in the US?,"I'm looking for a replacement to the Smartthings Button Remote since those seem to be gone, and really like the options from Aqara (especially [this](https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-MFKZQ01LM-Cube-Control-Panel/dp/B07S9G5MR6) sweet cube controller) **but** I don't like that they have their own independent app, and it seems like all my devices would have to be added there too, just like Smartthings.

I'm mostly concerned because I don't know enough about smart home cybersecurity, especially when it relates to Chinese companies. My understanding is that they have a less-than-stellar track record as far as data collection is concerned, but like I said, I'm far from an expert on that kind of thing.

Anyone done thorough research into Xiaomi/Aqara enough to know if they're a safe/secure choice? If they're not, are there relatively straightforward steps I can take to mitigate any risks?

"Installed Amcrest Video Doorbell, fried internal doorbell","I have an Amcrest Video Doorbell that I tried to hookup today. I learned that a 16V 30VA transformer was required, so I turned off the breaker for that area, replaced the current 16V 10VA transformer with the new one, and the original doorbell still worked fine. I then switched the breaker back off, and then installed the (what I assume is) ground loop supplied by Amcrest and hooked it up to the same two terminals on the original doorbell itself, as instructed. I then proceeded to hook up the Amcrest Video Doorbell to the outdoor doorbell wiring, and then turned the breaker back on. I heard a humming get louder and louder, and an unfortunate, electrical smell. I turned off the breaker, and reverted back to my original setup excluding the new transformer. The doorbell only now makes a low hum noise each time I push the doorbell ringer. I believe that somehow it was fried. What did I do wrong, and are there any suggestions as to how I can remedy this?

Best wifi mesh system for my situation?,"Hello Everyone!
Hope everyone is well and safe.
Basically my situation is that I'm looking for a mesh system best tailored for my situation.

My current situation consists of:
- From the UK
- With Virgin Media M200 (200mbps) 
- house is around 2800 sq ft
- house is made of brick
- house is around 3 floors
- my room is on the second floor
- virgin media modem is placed on the second floor in other room
- budget £200 tops
- must have ethernet connection on mesh points.

So I'm getting this mesh system for gaming (ps5). I'm currently with Virgin media m200mbps, I only get such speeds when standing right next to the modem but once I'm in my room I only get around 50mbps. So basically I wanted to get the most out the Internet package I'm on. The most important room is my room which is where I'm going to put one mesh point and use an ethernet cable to connect my PS5 to that mesh point. My goal is to get the full 200mbps provided by my modem to the PS5.

Some issues tho, I was told that the mesh poinys will be half the speed of the Internet provided by the modem, is this true? (Hopefully not)
I cannot run a ethernet cable from my ps5 to the modem as they are in different rooms on the same floor, so thats not an option.

Thank you for taking the time to read my situation.
Bare in mind I'm completely new to home WiFi stuff as I have only ever used the WiFi modem provided by the broadband

Quick edit: should I just get a third party router like from netgear, comnect that to the modem and connect my devices alone to the router and the rest to the modem.

Any advice would be appreciated!

Smart plug to control battery percentage... beneficial or not?,"So I have a robot vacuum and noticed it being on charge with the battery at 100% most of the time. 

So to save the battery health in the long term, I installed a smart plug which turns on and off to allow the battery to stay at about 80%. It turns off at night etc.

Sensor to detect power,Hi guys. I want to do cooled TV cabinet with fans. I do not want the fans to run all the time or have them manually turn off or on.

Best teachable RF bridge/hub to use with Apple Home/homebridge?,"I have 14 Internorm window blinds that are controlled by an iOS app that talks to a Mediola AIO gateway/hub device. The iOS app is pretty rubbish and the devices are neither HomeKit nor Alexa-compatible. I've been developing a homebridge plugin so that I can control them from the Apple Home app. It works, but after a while the Mediola device stops working and the blinds no longer respond to either the iOS app or the Home app, although they do still work with their own remotes. My conclusion is that the Mediola device can't cope with the HomeKit/homebridge polling.

I believe the blinds are controlled via RF, and I would like to find an alternative hub/bridge/gateway/whatever you want to call it to use instead of the Mediola. I want one that:

* can be taught the RF commands to open &amp; close each blind, learning from the existing remotes
* will work with Apple Home, so be either directly HomeKit-compatible or via a homebridge plugin, or have an API available so that I can write my own homebridge plugin
* doesn't need Internet access in order to work (i.e. no subscription required, all traffic on LAN only etc).

How to use SmartThings cast-web-api to trigger custom sounds/audio on Google Home speakers,"This works by installing cast-web api, WAMP server, and using a simple Webcore piston.

Basically, cast-web api uses the ""broadcast"" feature of Google speaker devices to play text-to-speech whenever a SmartThings automation is triggered. For example, if a button gets pushed, you could have a Google Mini say ""Good morning!""

I decided to take it a step further. I downloaded some free audio files, stored them in a folder on my computer, hosted them locally using WAMPserver, and used Cast-web api to play those .mp3 files on my Google Home speakers. You could record your own voice or use free .mp3 clips you find online.

This worked really well for Halloween but there's definitely a lot of other use cases. For example, if someone presses my Ring Doorbell, then it'll play creepy witch laughing sounds on a Google Mini (which I've set on my porch). There's tons of other ways you could make use of this setup: 

 • If window opens after 11pm, record custom audio to ""shout"" at intruder.

 • If motion detected, then play ""alarm"" sound

 • If leak is detected, then verbally announce via Google Home speakers.

I'm actually quite surprised that I haven't found a guide online to do this, so I decided to create one for you guys: https://smarthomepursuits.com/play-custom-audio-through-google-home-speakers-using-smartthings-automations/

"Outdoor motion sensing, camera &amp; Xaomi Aqara tie-in","Hi everyone. I was hoping to get some recommendations on how best to get some new functionality into my current ecosystem. I'd like to avoid having too many different hubs and apps and systems going on.

I have a couple of TP-Link smart outlet switches that use a Kasa app, and a couple from Zoozee that use a Smart Life app. In general, I control these with Google Nest minis / Google Home app. I have 4 Xiaomi Aqara temp/humidity sensors, but I don't like the Xiaomi hub or interface. 

Here's the functionality I'd like to add:

1. I'd like to be able to send alerts based on temp or humidity and capture history to my NAS drive. I haven't seen how to do that with the Xiaomi hub. Would setting this up with Smartthings give the functionality I want? Other suggestions?
2. I have outdoor light fixtures (2 sets of 2 fixtures - one on 1 switch, one is 3-way). Ideally I'd like these on a timer with motion sensing. ie. come on at dusk and stay on until 9pm, then only when motion is sensed. Possibly add geofencing instead of motion sensing. What's a robust motion sensor that works outside?

My current ideas for #2 are:

* Ikea Tradfri bulbs &amp; motion sensor. I don't know how well the motion sensor would work outside.
* These [motion-sensing light bulbs](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/feit-electric-intellibulb-motion-activated-60-watt-equivalent-a19-90-cri-led-light-bulb-soft-white-2700k-/1001340066) \- not a smart solution, but would get me most of the way.
* [TP-Link lightswitch](https://www.amazon.ca/TP-Link-Required-Requires-Assistant-HS200/dp/B01EZV35QU/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&amp;keywords=kasa+light+bulb&amp;qid=1605377298&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-8) \- would just be on a schedule I guess. I was also thinking about adding a camera - not sure if the Kasa camera motion detection can trigger the light switches. I'd also have to make sure I have a neutral wire in the boxes.

I'd appreciate any suggestions, cautions or guidance.

Is this crazy. NOT prewiring for shades during construction and just using batteries?,"So I am doing my own low voltage wiring in our house that is almost finished up framing.  I am going with Lutron Ra2 select and I have 13 windows that will 100% have automated shades and then a handful more that might some day (probably 50/50 chance).  Was planning on the Lutron Sivoia QS wireless.

My initial plan was to pre-wire for power with a standard 18/2 wire and use the clear connect for control.  However, at the window locations that I am unsure if we ever will put in shades I have no idea how I would pre-wire for power and be able to access it later without it hanging down through (obviously unsightly).

So now I am thinking since I am uncertain that I should just not pre-wire anything and then go with batteries. None of the window locations will be hard to access the batteries (i.e. No huge windows) and if they last 3 years that doesn't sound like too much trouble.

Microchip pet feeder that has a timer?,"A little bit of a different post than the others I’ve seen on here but I think it still applies. I have a SureFlap pet feeder that only opens when it detects the microchip of the intended pet.

Is there anyway to like open it up and get whatever mechanism that makes it to go into HOTS to work or do I have to bring it in?  Any help is appreciated.",Pure i9 robot vacuum won’t go into “WiFi-hotspot mode” Ok so I was given a Pure i9 a long time ago and I’ve never managed to get it to pair with the app I tried a billion times restarted the robot took the batteries out updated the firmware you name it but the problem was never solved It never goes into WiFi-hotspot mode The 3D vision WiFi never shows up in my list of available WiFi connections on my phone Your supposed to get a “HOTS” on the display when you turn it upside down but it just doesn’t Is there anyway to like open it up and get whatever mechanism that makes it to go into HOTS to work or do I have to bring it in Any help is appreciated
Aeotech nano switch alternative?,"I have half a dozen of the now apparently discontinued Aeotec micro switch G2 (2nd edition) installed for some various lighting.  One of them has gone bad after a few years and I need to replace it.  Looks like the ""nano switch"" from Aeotec is the current product I would want to replace it with.  Before I buy that are there any suggestions on a different comparable device?  I like the G2.  Aside from this dead one, they've been a solid purchase.  Just exploring options.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-14 17:21:55,Aeotech nano switch alternative?,"I have half a dozen of the now apparently discontinued Aeotec micro switch G2 (2nd edition) installed for some various lighting.

Thermostat for AirBNB (Florida) that will automatically set temp when guests not around?,"Hi all. Love this thread (have a c4 system at home). We've got a rental condo in Florida that is mostly airbnb'd. Would love to put in an 'automated' thermostat that will (a) let me set the min/max temp that a guest can set the temp to, (b) automatically sets the temp to X deg when no motion has been sensed for Y hours ... eg. set the temp to 80 deg F after 24 hours of no motion.

What we DON'T want is to have to login and set/reset temps remotely. We want something we can set and forget. Also, we don't have any automation controllers in the condo so the thermostat needs to be self-contained/self-automating.

What thermostats or solutions would you recommend? Anybody have experience doing this in a rental airbnb that can share experience?

Thanks!",r/homeautomation,2020-11-13 16:18:07,Thermostat for AirBNB (Florida) that will automatically set temp when guests not around?,"Hi all. Love this thread (have a c4 system at home).

"Schematic for house wiring, mapping breakers?","Before beginning large-scale replacement of switches, outlets and lights, I'm planning to graphically map my home's electrical, particularly to map each breaker to its lights, receptacles and appliances.

Need suggestions on a remote control for AC splits when not renting,So we bought a place we plan to rent. It has Fujitsu splits and we want to be able to control the temp remotely especially thru an app. We’re not looking to regulate or monitor AC while renting but rather when it’s empty like in the winter - make sure pipes don’t freeze. We don’t know where to start.
