Home Security for Poor Wifi,"Does anyone have a suggestion for a simple security setup? The situation... this will be at my house that is unoccupied. There is wifi, however it is quite poor. On speed test I’m getting maybe 2 upload and 5-8mbps download. I am looking to be notified of someone entering when I am not there. A ring doorbell would be enough for me, but I don’t think that will work properly with such slow wifi. 

Would a hub and door sensors work properly to send me a notification without clogging up the wifi? 

I briefly looked at the yolink hub and contact sensors. Not sure if that would work or not? 

Any tips would be helpful!",r/homeautomation,2020-11-28 01:14:52,Home Security for Poor Wifi,"Does anyone have a suggestion for a simple security setup?

Roborock E3 vs Eufy 30c Max,"Hi everyone! Please help me make up my mind. 

After doing some research on which robot vaccum to get I came down to these two options. I couldn't find a review that has tested both of them so all the information I got were from different websites. 

I think that Roborock E3 offers me the much needed mopping for an incredible accessible price compared to other robots and it is also silent (55db), the downside to this is that it is out of stock on Amazon (I live in the Netherlands) and no information when it would be back. I also can't seem to find it available to buy anywhere else.

Eufy 30c Max offers some good options for its low pricing and I have also heard a lot of people who enjoy theirs. From what I found it makes noise at around 68db, which is a bit louder than e3. It also has a great deal on it's official website running for two more days where I can get 100 euros discount and get it for 200 euros. I would also be getting it pretty soon as it is not sold out. Its stripe delimitation that comes with it are a great plus as well, but I would still go for the E3 on this price difference just for the mopping.

My questions are:
1. Should I wait for Roborock to get in stock or profit now of the 100 euro discount and get Eufy?  
2. What are your experiences with Roborock E3 / Eufy 30c Max?
3. Am I missing something from my research that would settle my view on only one of them?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-28 08:17:44,Roborock E3 vs Eufy 30c Max,"Hi everyone!

Creative in/out of bed triggers for nighttime or morning automations?,"I'm curious what ways people have come up with to trigger automations just by going to bed or waking up.

Looking for the mythical power strip,"Gurus, can you help find one?

1. Surge protection on most of the outlets (prefer ALL)

2. Outlets spaced apart

3. Dust protection for outlets (my favorite Belken has this)

4. USB-A and USB-C ports

5. USB-C that can charge a laptop

6. Smart power strip (to prevent vampire power loads)

I found an MKSENSE that almost fits this except #5 (has USB-C for phones) and does not have #6.

Thanks!!",r/homeautomation,2020-11-27 20:48:19,Looking for the mythical power strip,"Gurus, can you help find one?  1. Surge protection on most of the outlets (prefer ALL)  2.

Wallmounted tablet to control home? how? what?,"I want to have a tablet wall mounted to control the home, play music from, show youtube cooking videos etc. The google [nest hub](https://www.pricerunner.dk/product/1200x630/1871587345/Google-Nest-Hub.jpg) is a great solution, but it has a protruding speaker back that I don't want - I want it to mount flush against the wall.

It seems there was something called ""Ambient Mode"" last year, which was supposed to turn a regular tablet into a sort of nest hub - any experience with that?

Absolute best solution would be a smaller version of Samsung The Frame - something that looks like a small painting when off, but can come alive as a google remote station as well.

Thinking about leaving SmartThings. Sugestions?,"Like the title says, I'm thinking of switching away from the SmartThings system. Their recent announcement that they are shifting away from the hardware has me wondering how much longer the SmartThings cloud will last. I've been looking at Hubitat and OpenHab as those were the only 2 I had heard about until about 5 minutes ago while scanning this subreddit. 

What other solutions besides HomeAssistant have I missed? With this mess with SmartThings,  I'm thinking I want a system that runs locally and doesn't depend on some random company's fortunes to continue working. 

I liked the look of OpenHab as it seemed as if it wasn't dependent on anything but a local computer and its ZigBee antenna, and seemed to be cheaper cost-wise. Hubitat on the other hand looked a bit like SmartThings but maybe slightly more local and cheaper in time investment.

My setup is currently a currently SmartThings hub running SmartThings sensors and Sengled devices with a few Sylvania bulbs tossed in for good measure, and a couple of WiFI plugs hooked into Alexa through Globe Suite.

Need Advice on Bathroom Light Occupancy sensor + Dimming ON A SCHEDULE,"I have a hall bathroom with no natural lighting. this is used by my young kids, who regularly leave the lights on.
To fix this, I've added a *Lutron Occupancy Sensor* to turn the lights on and off automatically, which works well. **The problem is that when the lights come on at night for a bathroom trip, it's too bright. If I dim the lights for nighttime use, it's too dark during the day**.

I'd like to figure out a way to keep the occupancy sensor working 24/7, plus dimming *on a schedule*. every solution I've come up with is missing something. Either I lose the bright lights at day, or the dim lights at night, or I lose the auto on/off functionality altogether. Or I have to have a second light or keep one powered on constantly.

I've briefly looked at smart lights like the HUE, which I know can do auto-dimming on a schedule, but I'm not sure they can work with the Lutron occupancy sensor if they lose power altogether when 'off'. Am I missing something?

Pellet stove control with a smart thermostat,"Currently I have a pellet stove, that uses a Nest thermostat for control. The Pellet stove has two modes for control with a thermostat.

Mode 1 “Pilot on”: in this mode the pellet stove always stays on. When the thermostat calls for heat it switches to a preset value (2-6 set manually on the side). When the thermostat doesn’t require heat it goes to the lowest setting (#1).

Mode 2 “Pilot Off”: Pellet stove runs in the same way as above except for after the thermostat hasn’t called for heat in 45 minutes the stove enters shut down mode. Takes about 10 minutes to fully shut down, and then waits for the thermostat to call for heat again before entering the startup (which again is another 10 minutes or so).

The issue: During fall and spring when the days are more than -5°C (23° F) the thermostat doesn’t require heat often enough to justify staying in the Pilot Off mode. So it cycles on and off often. But in the other mode the house can hit 30°C if not turned off manually.

My thoughts are maybe I can integrate something between the Nest and the heater that could demand heat for 5 minutes if the temperature is within a couple degrees of the set temperature. My a raspberry Pi (have one lying around that I use for game emulation about once a year)? Or maybe there is a better smart thermostat that could have an extra constraint put on it.

"Proxmox users, what do you use for NAS software? For backing up Android photos, etc.","I have a proxmox box with a spare large HD.  I was wondering what you folks use for NAS software?  Something like FreeNAS or OMV?  I was thinking of passing the HD directly to the ubuntu VM that would host the NAS (hoping it comes as a container).

The point of an airgapped surveillance system,"Hi. 

I'm in the process of setting up a home surveillance system, using MotioneyeOS and raspberry pis. 

Because of security concerns I intend to use wired cameras and an airgapped server/storage. However, it dawns on me, that a potential intruder might, once he discovers that he is being taped, follow the wire to the central server and trash it. 
Further more, I'd like to get a notification in case an intrusion is detected. Maybe even have the possibility to check the cameras from my phone. However, I find that to be a major security concern, leaving an open port to my network and surveillance system.

I'm aware that I can't have it both ways. I guess I'm looking for input on how others have done it and general advice.

Help me make a steep ladder safer with motion detecting light!,"Hello!

I'm relatively new to home automation. I've got a Google Nest as well as a bunch of IKEA smart lights and a few Telluds WiFi smart sockets. Very basic stuff, but it gets the job done with controlling lights.

My apartment has a very steep ladder/stairway to a semi-floor. Like a small space above the kitchen where we have the beds etc. It's a rare and interesting design, but it makes more space in the apartment. Regardless, this ladder/stairway is extremely steep and ~2m tall, and I fear the day where my girl or I need to go down and pee and fall down the ladder in the darkness. So I'd like to install a motion detector that lights up the ladder, akin to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/c3z2k8/would_love_to_have_this/). I do not need it to be that fancy or have a delay between each step. I also don't need to drill or hide the cables, since it's more of a ladder than a stairway I can just tape the cables to the back of the ladder and it'll look nice enough.

So, what equipment do I need to be able to make this work? I want it to work both automatically through motion detectors (both on the bottom and top of the ladder) as well as through voice commands through Google Home.

I have extremely limited programming knowledge, took a course or two in C++ in high school many years ago, so I'd prefer something simple. 

I think it'd be cheapest to use those LED-strips that you can cut to length perhaps? Though I have some experience soldering, I've never understood exactly HOW they work, as I assume you need some driver for them as well?

If someone knows any decent and simple guides for this it'd be greatly appreciated!",r/homeautomation,2020-11-27 15:58:33,Help me make a steep ladder safer with motion detecting light!,"Hello!

Where do I aim my sights,"Hello!

Wife and I are closing on a house this December and are hoping to add i some home automation.

Currently we use google home as our assistant. We have a few Hue white bulbs that connect to our google home, and a first gen Sonos Play that connects to our google home.

Additionally we have a smart LG air conditioner that is connected to the google home and we have a smart capable asus Blue Cave router but I haven’t hooked that into the system.

Those are all the currently in use devices, I do also have two TPlink smart plugs not being used as well as a Wink 2 hub I got on clearance a year or so ago and haven’t used.

Looking forward we like google home as our assistant. Additionally we mainly would like to use smart light switches, plugs and maybe a doorbell in the future. I’m sure once we have our first child an indoor security camera will be coming.

I’m wondering which sort of hub will work best?

Should I stick with the wink 2? Is that going to limit my options? Or maybe switch to home assistant on the Raspberry Pi?

I’m pretty tech savvy and not afraid of some work but I’d rather not juggle more than one system.

If we have to retire some of the smart devices we have now it won’t be the end of the world.

Looking for any and all advise!

Trying to figure out which cameras and/or system to buy.,"I have the ring doorbell and love it. I want to add 2-4 cameras to my house for security and to see my dogs playing when they go out in the backyard. 

I have been looking for months and when I see something I like, I find a post saying it is terrible. Honestly, I am more lost after all of my research than I was before I started. 

I would like to be able to monitor the cameras from anywhere, want to have them show me live video as I click on the app, want to record data and want to be able to record at night. 

I have been saving up, so I can spend up a little for a system, but I feel lost on which one would actually meet my needs. 

I have asked for a Google hub for Christmas that I will use as an alarm clock so it would be great to be able to look at the cameras using it (although not required).

Which smart radiator valves for integration in Home Assistant?,"I'm looking to replace all 3 of my existing regular radiator valves with smart ones, that i can integrate in my Home Assistant system running on my raspberry pi. I have zigbee available with a cc2531 stick. 

I'm really looking for something that doesn't force me to use an extra gateway just for the valves and i don't get which gateways can be emulated/replaced by Home Assistant so that i can pair the valves with it directly. 

I found some Tuya valves with zigbee that should work right out of the box, but i'm more interested in something with more quality like Homematic, Tado, etc.. 

Is the homematic bridge necessary for using their valves? Please help me look through this chaos.

"Battery operated dry contact relay to act as a thermostat, looking for suggestions","I have a few Xiaomi Temperature and Humidity sensors in the house. I also have an ancient Swedish forced air electric heating system, which has been hacked and modified by previous owners. It is connected to a thermostat that seems to switch the furnace on and off by closing a contact which has low voltage in it. I would like to replace that thermostat with something I can control with my phone.  


I originally thought I'd just get a Mi Hub and an Aquara relay, but it was pointed out to me that the relay works on 230V (Europe) and it is not possible to simply connect it instead of the existing thermostat. I need something which has its own power, ideally battery, that is able to close a separate circuit (the one where the furnace gets its signal from). I believe that is called a dry contact relay, but I wasn't able to find one on any existing ecosystems. I would prefer using my Xiaomi Bluetooth Temperature sensors that can connect via Mi Home, but not absolutely necessary.

"TP-Link HS200 off with only one black wire, or flickers with two"," Hello!  


I'm trying to connect a couple TP-Link HS200s around my house. Unfortunately, I'm running into issues in 2 locations.  


First is a light switch in a 2 gang box with a GFCI outlet. This one has 1 black wire, 1 white wire, and ground. Here, the switch has power, but cannot turn the light on. I assume this is because one powers the switch, and the other is the load to the light. Is there a way I could chain off the GFCI power?  
[https://imgur.com/a/4jkyH1o](https://imgur.com/a/4jkyH1o)  


The second is a switch that operates a can light and a fan (with 3 bulbs). This has 2 black, 1 white, and ground. When connecting here, the switch gets powered, but only the can light turns on. The fan gets no power.

Zigbee/Z-Wave switch questions for different applications,"What experiences or thoughts do you have with regard to switches for circuits with a varying number of poles, types, and purposes? I’m new to the HA realm, and after all the research I’ve done, I’ve come away with even more questions than answers.

• What switches work for exhaust fans, since many can’t carry the inductive load from fans?

• What switches are the most economical and reliable when all that’s needed is to simply turn them on/off by touching the actual switch and by an app/trigger?

• What switches work with 3 and 4-way circuits and is it actually possible to only replace one switch in these circuits?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-26 17:42:19,Zigbee/Z-Wave switch questions for different applications,"What experiences or thoughts do you have with regard to switches for circuits with a varying number of poles, types, and purposes?

Which System to use?,"Hey there, I'm just starting out with getting proper Home Automation and am looking at what system to use for it.

Since there are many Shelly devices already built into my house, I'd like to stick with them.

There are some rather special points to match for me, so I thought I'd just ask the more experienced people here:

**What I'm looking for:**

* Fast and reliable system (near-realtime communication would be great)
* Self hosted (no 3rd party cloud services)
* Neat looking Android-App and - if possible - a WebUI aswell.
* Should **not** rely on Multicast, as the devices and clients are spread out over multiple networks
* Broad range of automation options (like conditional instructions etc.)

**Solutions I'm looking at:** (that are compatible to my devices)

* MQTT
* OpenHAB
* HomeAssistant
* ioBroker
* Domoticz
* Nymea

If anyone has some informations about one of these for me, whether they work well for you or not, why you'd advise for or against one, I'd be very happy to hear from you.

Whilst writing this, I'm read through all the details of the different systems and it's just overwhelming. So please don't see this post as a call to let others make my work, I'm just looking for some feedback from people who're already experienced and might have something to tell that won't be mentioned in specsheets, or similar.

Need advice on subscription-less solution to smart garage system,"I recently had a ""smart"" Chamberlain garage installed and it's so quiet that I'm not able to hear the garage door open or close. This becomes a problem when my family goes in/out of the garage door and catches the home occupants by surprise.

Is there a subscription-less solution I can implement (compatible with Alexa or Google)? I was thinking along the lines of a cheap motion detector. Any thoughts?

Is there anyway to automate the outdoor rolling/unrolling a large amount of material to block a neighbor's lights?,"Hello,

This is a [x-post that I put on Home Improvement](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeImprovement/comments/k18faj/anyway_to_block_a_neighbors_flood_lights_without/) asking about blocking a lights shining from a neighbor. Ideally, I wanted to have some sort of automated way of rolling/unrolling or moving some material that would block the lights. I understand I may not have been perfectly clear with that. Also, I think there is a different mindset in this subreddit.

While I got some good feedback, my focus is not doing anything to antagonize the neighbor or do anything illegal. If this eventually comes to a legal situation/solution, I want to be in the clear of having done anything wrong. So my thinking was just put up something to block his lights that doesn't affect him.

The ideal would be a roll of about 40 feet x 4 feet of material that could be spread across a fence automatically.

Any suggestions if this can be achieved (or other ideas), or am I just dreaming?

Thank you.

 \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

I hope this is an appropriate place to ask this question. I thought all those with building skills/experience might have some good suggestions.

I have a neighbor who has installed these very bright flood lights that he does not turn off, even when he's not home. I have spoken to him a few times (very diplomatically) and given him some suggestions so he can keep the lights on, just redirect them, or shade them so they don't shine onto my property and be a potential cause of my spouse's migraines (While it is true my spouse gets several migraines a month, these lights have not directly caused one...yet). For some reason keeping his driveway and backyard fully lit until 1:00 AM is more important that my spouse's health (which he said) This is also against town code but that doesn't seem to matter to him or the code enforcers in my town - there is no enforcement despite my many emails.

Even though he's a jerk, I don't want to be. I don't want to use a BB gun or do any sort of destruction to his property, no matter how aggravating it is. I don't think I will escalate it to a legal battle, but we'll see how long my patience holds out. Who has the time for this sort of nonsense?

So, in trying to be a good person and not do any revenge lighting (he'd probably welcome it), I was wondering if there a way I could easily put up some sort of netting or light-blocking material between us? I'd like to keep it easy and inexpensive.

There is a a six-foot fence between us, that I own. I'm thinking the material would have to be light enough that the wind doesn't take it down and also easy for me to put up and take down. I don't want a giant tarp up in my backyard all day. I am thinking it should be about 40 ft x 4 ft. I did see [some mylar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083775346/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&amp;pd_rd_i=B083775346&amp;pd_rd_w=ZjbqU&amp;pf_rd_p=7d37a48b-2b1a-4373-8c1a-bdcc5da66be9&amp;pd_rd_wg=xvqmB&amp;pf_rd_r=8JYEXM3TM30ZX6M1FBG1&amp;pd_rd_r=443ef3b9-f8b8-48e4-b071-c614a273d3e8&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyUFI2SU9LT0cwSzVVJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzk2MDY4MzlUQzNGVjZZVFpGOSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjg0ODU5MlpNMElIOU5PWFZTNCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2RldGFpbCZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) and it might work, but the mylar is shiny and I don't want me doing this to be a ""dick move"". I don't want to be confrontational, I just want the light gone.

My wild fantasy would be I can somehow have a automated setup that when I hit the magic button (z-wave?) and a shade is drawn or unrolled across the fence to block the light.

Smart Curtains - Somfy / Quoya / Others?,"A year or so ago I got a quote for some Somfy curtains for 5 windows (8ft by 43in) and it came to about $1,000 a window, without fabric.

Smart Gate solution,"I’ve been researching options for a smart gate solution, but can’t seem to find anything that fits the needs:

I have a fenced property with a motorized gate and want to add some smarts:

- external keypad that is programmable from the internet.  Use case is to be able to add a new code for a renter for a week, then delete the code, all remotely.
- push to call functionality (voip of course) so it acts as a doorbell
-relay control via an app or API (so I can open the gate to let a delivery in)
- any kind of integration with a camera so I can grab a frame from a camera when the talk button is pushed (camera is unifi wired g3 camera)
-Poe powered would be bonus points to simplify wiring and power requirements
-outdoor rated gear and hardened since this will be mounted on a pole outside the gate.

These capabilities all exist for doorbells and smart-locks; but not in components I can put together for a gate.  Anyone come up with a solution like this?

One idea is to wire an actual smart doorbell and a wife access point down by the gate and use a few apps to accomplish this.  No IP programmable keypad solution to a relay seems to exist.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-26 04:14:41,Smart Gate solution,"I’ve been researching options for a smart gate solution, but can’t seem to find anything that fits the needs:  I have a fenced property with a motorized gate and want to add some smarts:  - external keypad that is programmable from the internet.

How I my normal(dumb) washing machine announces it is completed through Alexa,"My washing machine is in the basement and I do not always hear the chime when it finishes. I was able to have Alexa say ""The washing machine has completed"" when the cycle finishes. This is how I did it. I would love feedback if anyone has a cleaner solution. 

1. I had a smart plug. I used a higher W plug ([1800W, 15A Plug](https://www.amazon.com/TOPGREENER-Monitoring-Appliances-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B07FDFLFJL/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n2_0?cv_ct_cx=smart+plug&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=smart+plug&amp;pd_rd_i=B07FDFLFJL&amp;pd_rd_r=089498ff-b23a-4d16-9ec2-9d76282b34fc&amp;pd_rd_w=CvMiL&amp;pd_rd_wg=yFnEd&amp;pf_rd_p=1835a2a9-7ed8-48dc-ad07-fcd7527bd2bc&amp;pf_rd_r=09TP4CR1VPP1PPT63CSK&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1606331639&amp;sr=1-2-80ba0e26-a1cd-4e7b-87a0-a2ffae3a273c)) because I was unsure of the power draw the machine would use. However, I think I could have used the normal smart plug(just make sure it has the ability to monitor power levels) because during my monitoring the power draw does not appear to get that high. Someone please correct me on this, if you know more. 
2. These plugs use the ""Smart Life"" app which has a feature for ""Energy Monitoring"".
   1. (Android) In the main home screen on the app hit ""smart"" at the bottom.
   2. Then hit the ""+"" in the top right corner to create a smart condition.
   3. Select ""when device status changes""
   4. Select your plug
   5. Select what you want to monitor. In my case I used ""Power"".
   6. Select the condition. In my example, I said ""=0W"". However, I think this is not exactly right and currently doing a little more testing. I figured, when the cycle finishes it won't draw more power. However, I have found that it does drop to 0 but then goes up to 3.8 and back to zero, and repeats this. I think I will test out ""&lt;4W"". 
   7. Hit Next to set up a task. I do 2 things. Firstly, I send notification. This sends me a message to my phone that the washer is done. For most of us, this is probably good enough... However I wanted Alexa to announce so I, secondly, (and here where the hacky part starts) I tell the app to shut off the plug as part of this trigger.... Simply put, when the plug uses 0 W, text me and then shut off the plug. 
3. In IFTTT, I set up an applet. This app triggers when the (smart life) plug turns off. When that triggers, I use sendAlexaActionByMkzense([https://mkzense.com/iftttrigger](https://mkzense.com/iftttrigger)) to run a routine in the Alexa App on my phone. 
   1. Then, go into your Alexa app on your phone. You will need to enable the Skill ""IFTTTrigger"". This will create 3 ""Smart Home Devices"". I named one of them ""washing machine"". A youtube video for how to set this up [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMr6ZrHia2Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMr6ZrHia2Q) [https://mkzense.com/iftttrigger](https://mkzense.com/iftttrigger)
   2. Go back to IFTTT to select the correct trigger to use with the sendAlexaActionByMkzense app. 
   3. Create a new routine in the Alexa app.
      1. Name it whatever you want.
      2. When this happens - Select Smart home, and then select your trigger created. 
      3. Add Action - Select ""Alexa Says"" and type in what you want her to say. I went with ""Your washing machine has completed.""
      4. (optional last step) - I am still trying to clean this up, but I also added an action to turn the plug back on. However, since my current trigger is set off when the plug = 0 W, it seems to be fluctuating between 4 and 0. It appears to be in a loop lol. I am think I may just turn not run this step and let the plug stay off. I can just hit the button when I do a load of laundry.

"Hiding the clutter of hubs, Raspberry Pi, etc","Hi,

I was wondering how people have dealt with the multiple wires and pieces of kit that a home automation system seems to accumulate?

My Sky router has two ethernet ports. At the moment one of those is connected to my NAS and the other to my Philips Hue hub. A Raspberry Pi, for Home Bridge, is getting delivered today and I've already run out of ports!

The Sky Router is ugly. The WD NAS and Philips Hue hub are okay looking. The Raspberry Pi looks kinda cool. However, all together it looks like a jumble sale of electronic parts sat on a small table next to the phone socket!

One idea I have is to buy a couple of WiFi Mesh devices. One will plug into the phone socket and look pleasing to the eye there! The other one will go in a cupboard and have an 5 or 8 port ethernet switch connected to it which all the other stuff will plug into.

Questions:

1. Will this work?
2. How have other people got around this?

Thanks,

&amp;#x200B;

Is the Roborock E4 unparalleled in its price range?,"So, according to most reviews I've seen, the E4 from Roborock, which often goes for under $200, is a great vacuum. It has the same suction as the more expensive S5 at 2000pa, 19 cfm of airflow - better than some high-end vacuums, a very large battery, and a somewhat sophisticated navigation system. And it seems to prevent most tangles, and I live with a large labrador that *sheds a lot*! 

I was eyeing the Neato D4 because of its large bin and great navigation system, but it cannot map multiple floors (which isn't an issue with the E4, as it has no mapping), and it is 50% more expensive than the E4.

To me, it seems that the E4 is almost as good as a high-end vacuum, especially since I don't care about the app features way too much.

What do i have to google to find an actuator for this valve?,"Right now i have to manually close or open this valve, is there any kind of adapter for this to get this working with a home made circuit? Or do i really have to swap the complete valve?

 I have only experience in electronics so im thankfull for any any help regarding this topic.

"Monitoring Electric Dryer - Looking to simplify. (240V/30A ""smart plug""???)","Greetings fellow Automators.

**Short Version:** I need what's essentially a Smart Plug that would work for an electric dryer. Circuit is 240V/30A. It needs to be WiFi-enabled, support power use monitoring, and ideally have some sort of REST API I can interface with.

**Looooong Version:** Our story begins with teenagers that forget they put a load of laundry in the washer and promptly forget they did so for 2-3 days. By that time, of course, there's funk in the air, and the clothes need to be rewashed.

I had an awesome solution involving a Wemo smart plug that monitored energy use and IFTTT (please, don't make this an IFTTT-hate thread), which fired off a message to a Telegram Group Chat that all of us in the house are subscribed to. Then Wemo had to go and ""improve"" things, after which, IFTTT never worked again.

One of the guys who works on my team suggested the Etekcity plugs from Amazon, knowing they also supported IFTTT. Unfortunately, their IFTTT support doesn't include triggers based on power usage, like the old Wemo did. So, naturally, me &amp; that guy spent some time with Postman and the source code to the VeSync python API as well as the Homebridge module, figuring out how to login to the API, then figuring out how to read out just the info for a specific device, and blammo, [my code was born](https://github.com/jcostom/plugmon).

Unfortunately, the dryer isn't as easy. We've got an electric dryer. I could swap for gas and then use the same code I've already written for the washer, but dropping $1k on a new dryer just to get notifications doesn't seem like the smartest use of our $$. So, for the time being at least, I'm stuck with the electric dryer. It's the older 3-pin plug on a 240V/30A breaker.

I saw folks playing around with Arduinos and CT clamps. I got myself a Huzzah32, loaded up Micropython, and was reading from the ADC-enabled GPIO pins relatively quickly. Unfortunately, I couldn't make sense out of the readings I was getting and eventually just gave up on that. I ended up swapping out for a Raspberry Pi connected to an 801s vibration sensor that had both Analog and Digital outputs. I'm using the digital output, since I don't really care how much the dryer is vibrating - I care \*that\* it's vibrating. The solution spans 2 project boxes - 1 on the wall that houses the Pi, another that just has the sensor, which is on the back of the dryer. More code and it's working. The code was finicky to get going. The [code is ugly](https://github.com/jcostom/vibinator) (Hey, I'm not a real programmer, I just pretend to be one on teh Interwebs) and literally takes thousands of averaged readings to work out if the dryer is really on, or just got bumped somehow.

Anyhow, back to the point. I'd like a solution that doesn't involve multiple boxes, adding compute power to my laundry room, and can be interfaced with remotely via a REST API. Anyone know of such a beast? My budget is up to $100, though I'm reasonably flexible on that, as I just pulled that number out of thin air.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-25 20:52:14,"Monitoring Electric Dryer - Looking to simplify.

Continuing with my humble home-made security system: alarm siren speaker now,"Hi again. I'm about to make an order on Amazon but the last step, for now (this hobby never ends), is a battery-powered alarm siren speaker. It'll be hidden somewhere. It needs to be loud. In case I buy a UPS in the near future, so that both the router and the Raspberry Pi + ConBee II will continue to work in case a burglar turns off the power of the apartment or something, even if there's no power in the apartment the loud siren will sound as soon as a burglar enters.

This would fail if the burglars used a frequency jammer, of course, but the type of burglar that burglarizes the kind of place I live in is not that sophisticated, in my opinion. Here that happens more at houses and not at humble small apartments. When we got burglarized through a balcony a few years ago, the bastards were probably very fast and were only looking for money and jewels. But anyway, it would still be interesting to see what you guys think about the risk of burglars using a frequency jammer and how you handle the issue.

Anyway, sorry I'm rambling. Any cheap battery-powered siren speaker that you recommend? Does Aqara or Xiaomi have one? Are they usually Zigbee or Wi-Fi? If they're Wi-Fi, can you make them play an mp3? It could be fun to, in addition to the alarm siren, play a real recording of police sirens slowly approaching from a far away street, or maybe my voice saying ""who's there!?""

In case I buy a UPS in the near future, so that both the router and the Raspberry Pi + ConBee II will continue to work in case a burglar turns off the power of the apartment or something, even if there's no power in the apartment the loud siren will sound as soon as a burglar enters.  This would fail if the burglars used a frequency jammer, of course, but the type of burglar that burglarizes the kind of place I live in is not that sophisticated, in my opinion. Here that happens more at houses and not at humble small apartments. When we got burglarized through a balcony a few years ago, the bastards were probably very fast and were only looking for money and jewels. But anyway, it would still be interesting to see what you guys think about the risk of burglars using a frequency jammer and how you handle the issue.  Anyway, sorry I'm rambling. Any cheap battery-powered siren speaker that you recommend? Does Aqara or Xiaomi have one? Are they usually Zigbee or Wi-Fi? If they're Wi-Fi, can you make them play an mp3? It could be fun to, in addition to the alarm siren, play a real recording of police sirens slowly approaching from a far away street, or maybe my voice saying ""who's there!?""  Edit:  I found [this one] . It seems okay. Opinions anyone? Good integration into Home Assistant? (I use ConBee II - deCONZ).

Turning on Netatmo Thermostat via another tempature sensor?,"Hi!

I just got a netatmo thermostat and it works awesome, however because I just replaced my 2 wire already wired up thermostat with it, the temp sensor is in the hall which is warmer than the room which we are in most of the time.  
We have a netatmo healthy home coach in the room meassure tempature, and I was wondering if it was possible to link the two somehow either via HomeKit or somekind of rapsberry solution.  
Or should I just balance it out by setting it higher in the hall and that would be the easiest?

Anybody have any experience with this?  
Thanks,

How I made the cheapest home cctv system with Wyze Cams and HLS,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ue6tpcxc7b161.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74900039606560a0dfe8d29d5a82158c4f59bf0d

Hello there. I would like to share my experience with making the cheapest home cctv system. 

I'm a fan of WyzeCams and was trying to fit it into my smart home system for a while.

It's super cheap and specs are pretty good, but the only flaw is not stable RTSP firmware.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a solution that allows you to convert mp4 files from NFS to HLS stream.

That HLS stream could be fed to any modern video surveillance system.

Here is the URL to my repo: [https://github.com/n1ckyrush/wyzecam-hls](https://github.com/n1ckyrush/wyzecam-hls)

It's pretty simple nodejs script with ffmpeg. 

It's based on NFS hack (props to the original author!), you will find all instructions inside my repo.

&amp;#x200B;

After many months of fighting with RTSP and Wyze now it works flawlessly.

Hopefully it will make somebody life easier ✊

Feel free to shoot me any questions.

P.S. If you are interested in my whole journey with it, I made a long post about it: [https://n1ckyrush.com/en/blog/3-how-to-make-wyzecam-stream-stable-hls-instead-of-rtsp](https://n1ckyrush.com/en/blog/3-how-to-make-wyzecam-stream-stable-hls-instead-of-rtsp)",r/homeautomation,2020-11-25 03:56:15,How I made the cheapest home cctv system with Wyze Cams and HLS,"​     Hello there.

"Is Nest the best, or should I switch to ecobee? New house has 3 separate HVAC systems...","Moving to a new house and the new HVAC set up is a bit more widespread and unique. Basically, here is what I am dealing with to make it smart:

- 3 zone hot water baseboard main floor

- separate central air duct AC 2nd floor (different thermostat)
- mini split system heat/cool main floor (same condenser as central air, separate controls with remote)

Let’s disregard the mini splits as I will look into sensibo for controlling those if I even think it’s worth it

I most likely need to install a common wire

Main question is, are my 2 Nest 3rd gens running of SmartThings still the best option given my situation?

I am considering ecobee as it seems there’s an alternate solution to the common wire, and there’s the option for Apple HomeKit.

What to look out for when purchasing non-replaceable smart-components (before renovation)?,"Hello everyone,

We are about to completely renovate our new apartment. Currently Smarthome is in the back of the queue (because the apartment has to be made habitable first). Nevertheless I would like to inform myself a little bit now.

Currently I have a conglomerate of Fritzbox DECT radiator thermostats, Ikea Tradfri lamps, ESP8266 temperature sensors and various other ""gadgets"" available via homebridge for the Homekit ""Apple"" world.

Best voice assistant for only triggering automations?,"I've been using Home Assistant for most of my automations and have found it cumbersome to trigger a Home Assistant routine via Alexa and Google devices: I need to come up with clunky automation names to not confuse the assistant, the trigger phrasing is hard to fully customize, and I often find myself repeating myself to get things to work. 

I think part of this is because the assistants are geared towards doing a lot more than just home automation, so even though I may only have a dozen commands I want them to respond to, they are trying to do a lot more and thus are easily confused.

Wifi/Cloud Smart Devices into Homeseer - Newbie Question,"Its been roughly 8 years since I played with HomeSeer. Getting back into it now to start building local automation instead of cloud based.

I have Homeseer linked to Google Home that way I can control my ""local"" HS devices (Z-Wave, etc.) from Google Home. Is there not a way to bring my linked devices from Google Home down into HomeSeer so they show up in my HS4 device tree?

I am pretty sure the answer is going to be ""search for a HS Plugin to connect to those services"". I tried that and came up short. Is there a different method?

SwitchBot Curtain Review,"This is a review of my experience with the SwitchBot Curtain, purchased through a crowdfunding site. I tested the device on two sets of curtains, both grommet and back-tab styles. The curtains are moderately heavy, and mounted on extendable rods.

I have a number of home automation devices, controlled through both SmartThings and Google Home, and tested integrating it with my setup.

# Opening and closing curtains

As the main purpose of SwitchBot Curtain is to actually open and close your curtains, you'd expect it to do this well. Unless you have a very basic curtain setup of single non-adjustable rod with lightweight curtain, you'll likely be disappointed here. Perhaps the experience is better with rail style curtains?

* Gets stuck on the ""bump"" where curtain rod extends from wider to narrower width. That's a pretty big showstopper, and especially surprising since SwitchBot *specifically advertises it handling this situation*. My curtains open in the middle, so I was able to get one side working. Yay? Other people have had the same complaint on Kickstarter, but the company has not posted any public response other than to contact them through the app feedback. Some people have gotten it to work by smoothing the transition out with tape, but I think that workaround would look ugly personally.

* The Touch &amp; Go feature is supposed to assist when you try to operate the curtains by hand. Instead, nothing happens and the device actually makes it harder to move the curtain.

* The plastic hook part that goes over your rod projects a fair bit from towards your wall. If you have a double curtain rod, this might not be enough space. This was the case with one of my curtains, although I was able to get it working but flipping it around (which makes the calibration backwards, and puts the solar panel input port on the wrong side, but it works).

## Noise

It's not so noisy to be bothersome, but definitely loud enough that I wouldn't want to use it while I'm asleep. This defeats the use case of gently waking you up with some natural light before your alarm. You can also choose a ""silent"" mode which promises quiet while sacrificing some power to move heavier curtains. As the silent mode is more of a high pitched shriek, I decided to stick with the normal mode lest people think I'm torturing my curtains.


## Hardware

The overall build quality is decent. None of the little plastic parts broke during installation. The solar panels connect nicely to a port on the back, and come with a usb c cable if you need to mount them elsewhere. (I have not done enough testing with the solar panels yet to offer a review on them. My rod is either mounted too high, or not getting enough light in the winter, for them to charge.)


# Automation

Connecting to the device remotely or through other services requires an additional purchase of a SwitchBot Hub Mini. It's small and has limited range, although one Hub Mini can control multiple curtains if they are close enough. You can also connect other SwitchBot devices to the same hub. It would be nice if this could connect via zigbee, zwave, or wifi directly without another hub, but it does work.

It comes with some basic automation in the SwitchBot app, as well as compatibility with other home automation and voice assistant systems.

## Native App

You can schedule it to open or close for a specific time and days of the week. But you can't set it based on sunrise/sunset, exterior light level, or synced with your alarm, so I wouldn't recommend using this feature.

Even with the cloud connection working, it doesn't seem to be able to change curtain settings here from a different room in the house.

## Google Home

Simple to set up, and voice commands work as expected!

## SmartThings

Simple to setup the connection, but the actual automation settings are a bit confusing. In setting up my ""if"" condition, I can select closed, open, partially open, ""open or closed"", or a shade level percentage. In the ""then"" statement, I can only select shade level percentage. Does partially open include all the way open? Is shade level 100% open or closed? Who knows without experimenting. I'm not sure if this is on SmartThings' end or Switchbot's.

For backers, they also included extra hooks and curtain clips, which is a nice bonus in case they break.",SwitchBot Curtain Review This is a review of my experience with the SwitchBot Curtain purchased through a crowdfunding site I tested the device on two sets of curtains both grommet and back-tab styles The curtains are moderately heavy and mounted on extendable rods I have a number of home automation devices controlled through both SmartThings and Google Home and tested integrating it with my setup # Opening and closing curtains As the main purpose of SwitchBot Curtain is to actually open and close your curtains you'd expect it to do this well Unless you have a very basic curtain setup of single non-adjustable rod with lightweight curtain you'll likely be disappointed here Perhaps the experience is better with rail style curtains  Gets stuck on the bump where curtain rod extends from wider to narrower width That's a pretty big showstopper and especially surprising since SwitchBot specifically advertises it handling this situation My curtains open in the middle so I was able to get one side working Yay Other people have had the same complaint on Kickstarter but the company has not posted any public response other than to contact them through the app feedback Some people have gotten it to work by smoothing the transition out with tape but I think that workaround would look ugly personally  The Touch & Go feature is supposed to assist when you try to operate the curtains by hand Instead nothing happens and the device actually makes it harder to move the curtain  The plastic hook part that goes over your rod projects a fair bit from towards your wall If you have a double curtain rod this might not be enough space This was the case with one of my curtains although I was able to get it working but flipping it around which makes the calibration backwards and puts the solar panel input port on the wrong side but it works ## Noise It's not so noisy to be bothersome but definitely loud enough that I wouldn't want to use it while I'm asleep This defeats the use case of gently waking you up with some natural light before your alarm You can also choose a silent mode which promises quiet while sacrificing some power to move heavier curtains As the silent mode is more of a high pitched shriek I decided to stick with the normal mode lest people think I'm torturing my curtains ## Hardware The overall build quality is decent None of the little plastic parts broke during installation The solar panels connect nicely to a port on the back and come with a usb c cable if you need to mount them elsewhere I have not done enough testing with the solar panels yet to offer a review on them My rod is either mounted too high or not getting enough light in the winter for them to charge # Automation Connecting to the device remotely or through other services requires an additional purchase of a SwitchBot Hub Mini It's small and has limited range although one Hub Mini can control multiple curtains if they are close enough You can also connect other SwitchBot devices to the same hub It would be nice if this could connect via zigbee zwave or wifi directly without another hub but it does work It comes with some basic automation in the SwitchBot app as well as compatibility with other home automation and voice assistant systems ## Native App You can schedule it to open or close for a specific time and days of the week But you can't set it based on sunrise/sunset exterior light level or synced with your alarm so I wouldn't recommend using this feature Even with the cloud connection working it doesn't seem to be able to change curtain settings here from a different room in the house ## Google Home Simple to set up and voice commands work as expected ## SmartThings Simple to setup the connection but the actual automation settings are a bit confusing In setting up my if condition I can select closed open partially open open or closed or a shade level percentage In the then statement I can only select shade level percentage Does partially open include all the way open Is shade level 100% open or closed Who knows without experimenting I'm not sure if this is on SmartThings end or Switchbot's # Customer Service My experience with customer service was great They promptly replied to my problem and issued a full refund no hassle there For backers they also included extra hooks and curtain clips which is a nice bonus in case they break

Smart millivolt wall switch,"We have moved into a new house with a gas fireplace controlled by a wall switch. I took the switch out to look at it, and it seems to be a SkyTech fireplace millivolt on/off switch.

I’d like to change this switch to make it controllable, ideally with Alexa, but I’m open to any suggestions.

Help determine if I have a neutral wire,"I’m want to replace a dimmer, specifically, with a smart switch and was going to order the GE Z-Wave Smart Dimmer. It says a neutral wire is required, and I *think* I have them (circled in the third photo linked below) but they don’t appear to be connected to any of the switches and it looks like they all terminate in a wire nut. Is that accurate?

If that’s the case, do I just pick any of them and connect it to the GE switch or do I have to pick a specific neutral wire? 

If that’s not the case, what other smart dimmer would you recommend that doesn’t require a neutral that works with LED bulbs?

Thanks so much for your help!

Smart bulb with local http API?,"Hi,  


I'm just getting into home automation so I'm not really aware of what's out there and was hoping someone could point me in the right direction for this. I'm looking for some light bulbs that I can control completely locally without an internet connection.  


An ideal candidate would be something with a simple get/post http API. For example, the smart outlets I have now can be controlled through simple requests like hostname/cm?cmnd=power%20on.  


So far the only smart bulbs I can find require a cloud service/internet connection though, which is a no-go for me.

Best smart switch,"So I just had a GE paddle switch seem to go out. My garage lights were going on and off. The switch was audibly clicking with each on and off so you could definitely hear the power being cut. A quick google returned a Reddit thread where someone else experienced this and the cause mentioned was a bad relay. 

Are GE switches known for this? I have a few others with zero problems but didn’t wanna pick up another if they are known to do this after a few years. 

I’m also running on Hubitat if that makes a difference in choice for anyone. I keep it pretty simple, just wanting my lights on at a certain time and the ability to turn on/off remotely if needed. My only complaint when I was setting up the Hubitat with them all the mesh network didn’t seem to work.

IFTTT alternative to for Magic Home...,"Since IFTTT has become another subscription model, I've deleted the account.

Nest system basically bricked IMO,"So I bought a nest camera/alarm system in 2017. And it was great. In late 2018 I really started to get into Home automation and the works with nest system worked out with Alexa. I like that you can ask Alexa to show a camera and it throws it on the tv. However I’m annoyed by how limited things are when google bought nest. As if I’ve lost functionality after paying the heavy price tag for nest equipment 

So ignorantly when google bought nest I migrated my account thinking things would be fine. But they were not fine. I’m annoyed that not only IFTTT is basically disabled but I’m also annoyed that you really can’t utilize the motion detection to turn on lights. Most annoying, I would love to use google nest hub/Alexa show to alert me while I’m sleeping if people are on porch deck. However it only alerts google nest hub if they ring the doorbell and not for general recognizing of people on my porch in the middle of the night.

Control Smart Life RGB without cloud using Home Assistant?,"(question at the end)

Context: 
I have a bunch of Smart Life lights (Tuya) which are either Sengled or Lumiman.
They work with my Google Home app as well as the Smart Life app as well as Lumia Stream on PC.

In general, I am able to control on-off and preset colours using either of the apps listed above.

I've come up with a Python Script which is able to find the dominant colour of my screen and I wanted to sync this with my lights for ""mood lighting"".

Initially it worked decently with IFTTT but the lag was ridiculous as there were too many hops. Also, I am limited to 8 preset colours and 10 brightness levels.

I came across Home Assistant and it looks awesome and likely my way forward (especially with IFTTT no longer an option as such).

Question:
My question is if I can connect my Tuya based coloured smart lights _locally_ (without internet) to my Home Assistant/PC with Python Script to control RGB colours?

Otherwise, am I limited to investing in Phillips Hue?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-24 22:07:09,Control Smart Life RGB without cloud using Home Assistant?,"(question at the end)  Context:  I have a bunch of Smart Life lights (Tuya) which are either Sengled or Lumiman.

Inovelli Red Dimmer Switches,"Hello everyone,

Broadlink RM4 Pro RF Unreliable,"I'm having issues with Smith &amp; Noble blinds (Somfy rebadged I think). I learned the remote on the broadlink app and hooked it into Google Home. It works sometimes, but by no means is it reliable. Google recognizes the commands, however, sometimes the shades just don't move.

They are RF 433.92.

Does anyone have any experience? Could this be a bad RM4 Pro? Bad Internet (it's been a bit spotty with some packet loss), or potentially is the RF code from the remote done in a way that makes it difficult for broadlink to learn?

Can I do something useful/creative with an unused iPhone X?,"Hi all,

I have an iPhone X with a bad IMEI (long story, but I got my money back and got to keep the phone!), and I'm trying to think of a practical use for it.  The phone cannot get cellular service, but it can get wifi to connect to whatever it needs to.  I'm visualizing using it as a home controller, wall mounted somewhere (or as a secondary panel for our alarm system), but I'm also wondering if there are more effective uses for it that y'all have tried or read about.  Also, since it's a relatively newer iPhone, I wonder if any uses might take advantage of its processing power, better cameras, etc.

LED Crimp Pins,"I made an LED strip integrated into a book shelf.  I made the extension cables with a combination of splicing the existing connectors and making some dupont connectors.  I had a hard time getting the male connectors I made into the female sockets.  It seemed like the pins were just barely too big (diameter).  They were also too long, but that didn't affect things much, but I would prefer if they were shorter so that the connection closed all the way with no exposed pin.  I had originally intended to make all of the extensions and just not use the ones provided, but after having so much trouble, I decided to splice where I could.

So I have a question about the male crimp pins.  Maybe I just have a low quality one (very likely).  Are there different types?  The ones that I have look like they were stamped out of a sheet.  I think if I had one where it was a solid piece with a nice sharp point, I wouldn't have had these troubles.  I tried searching around for jst-xh male pins, and dupont male crimp pins.  Do this higher quality male pin exist?  If I do more of these, I want to avoid going through the trouble with the pins if possible.

Is there some other even easier way that is still reasonably priced?

Best Front Porch Smartlock? (w/ photos),"Hi! I’m trying to replace some locks on my new house and I have no idea what the best system may be as I seem to experiencing some analysis paralysis at this point. Any help all you knowledgeable people are willing to provide would be much appreciated!

I would like to replace my front porch lock and front door lock at the very least. At most I would like to add an additional smart lock to my back gate and back door. I will post some photos for reference. I have Alexa set up in the house but also have Nest products for the thermostat and smoke detectors and what not. Not married to any one system.

The main issue I run into with the front porch lock is I am not sure if there is a system that will work in the footprint that the current lock exists within. Particularly on the back side of the lock which has a metal box around it. (See photo)

Please Help! Independently control multiple lights from one switch.,"Hello fellow enthusiasts!

In my kitchen I have one wall switch that originally ran to a single florescent light. Many years ago a junction box was installed behind the florescent light and new wiring was added to ceiling boxes 6 ft from each end of the florescent fixture and track lighting was installed on those ceiling boxes. For the past 9 years the one switch has turned on the florescent light and the two sets of track lighting.

Ideally I am looking for a way to control each of the three groups of lights independently without trying to run new wiring down the wall. However, I would be happy if I could at least control the florescent light independently of the other two.
I would like some type of physical switch to turn them on and off and I would prefer they integrate with SmartThings so I can control them from my phone/Google Home/Alexa. 

If I needed to keep a dumb switch to turn them all on or all off that would be fine as long as I had voice control to turn them on/off independently.

I have searched the internet multiple times over the past year and can't seem to find what I'm looking for, or I'm just not looking for the right thing.

Ideally I am looking for a way to control each of the three groups of lights independently without trying to run new wiring down the wall. However, I would be happy if I could at least control the florescent light independently of the other two. I would like some type of physical switch to turn them on and off and I would prefer they integrate with SmartThings so I can control them from my phone/Google Home/Alexa.   If I needed to keep a dumb switch to turn them all on or all off that would be fine as long as I had voice control to turn them on/off independently.  I have searched the internet multiple times over the past year and can't seem to find what I'm looking for, or I'm just not looking for the right thing.   Any help would be greatly appreciated!",Please Help Independently control multiple lights from one switch Hello fellow enthusiasts In my kitchen I have one wall switch that originally ran to a single florescent light Many years ago a junction box was installed behind the florescent light and new wiring was added to ceiling boxes 6 ft from each end of the florescent fixture and track lighting was installed on those ceiling boxes For the past 9 years the one switch has turned on the florescent light and the two sets of track lighting Ideally I am looking for a way to control each of the three groups of lights independently without trying to run new wiring down the wall However I would be happy if I could at least control the florescent light independently of the other two I would like some type of physical switch to turn them on and off and I would prefer they integrate with SmartThings so I can control them from my phone/Google Home/Alexa If I needed to keep a dumb switch to turn them all on or all off that would be fine as long as I had voice control to turn them on/off independently I have searched the internet multiple times over the past year and can't seem to find what I'm looking for or I'm just not looking for the right thing Any help would be greatly appreciated
Flush wall mountable proximity sensor,"I would like to add two proximity sensors to my stairs. One at the top and one at the bottom. Whenever a person would step on the first step, I would like to stair lights to turn on. The thing is that I can't find a wall mountable flush sensor for European standards that I could use.

There are PIR motion sensors, but I don't think they would be my best choice, because we move past the stairs and I don't want the lights to turn on when somebody passes by the stairs. I want them to turn on only when someone actually want's to go up/down.

Moving into new house - what type of keypad would work with this door?,"I'm a noob here, so appreciate the help!

I'm closing on a house next week and want to install keypad locks. Ideally, will have one on the front door and one for the garage door.

My front door handle is pictured here. Can I tell from this photo what smart locks will be compatible? Unfortunately, don't have a picture of the inside. Do I need to know what the inside looks like to know what to buy?

Ideal functionality:

1. Enter code to get in (no key needed)
2. Can use the physical key as backup
3. \[Stretch goal -- is this doable?\]  Door unlocks when it senses my smartphone or my wife's smartphone nearby...so that I don't need to enter the password in that case

TYIA! 🙏

Z-Wave Hub working with unstable internet?,"Hello. This is my first time considering a smart hub, as I've got barely any smart appliances. My internet connection drops at random times, and sometimes I even have to reset the router for it to work again.
Is there a hub that would work with my Philips Hue/Yeelight, vacuum (Roborock S5), Google Nest Mini(?), and smartlock (z wave) even if the internet is down? My main concern is that all my smart appliances also reset every time I have to reset my router...

In case you wanted to know what a smart home is like during a brownout...,"Our lights were intermittently flickering at our house today, so I called the utility company who sent somebody out at record speed to investigate. After finding no issues with our house or meter, he started looking upstream at the various taps in our neighborhood.

The utility worker found a tap that needed to be replaced because a rubber sheath had melted (likely *because* of a poor connection) and he let us know that we should not lose power during the replacement process because they were wired in parallel (whatever that means in the context of power distribution).

Unfortunately, in the process of replacing equipment, we ended up with a rare brownout. For those unfamiliar, this is where you get only a portion of the voltage to your house. All sorts of weird shit happens with electronics, and lightbulbs will operate at a reduced brightness. 

I’m speculating we only had 1 hot leg of 2 and some electricity was going to neutral, but I’m not super well versed on household circuits. 

But to get to the point... I have about 10 smart dimmers and smart outlets and I can confidently report they do not tolerate brownouts well. At least half of them started spazzing out, clicking on and off rapidly. Some of them have an air gap you can pull, and some of them do not. I was really confused, because some of the LEDs in my house were working just fine but other stuff was not. So, I ran out to my breaker panel and shut off the main service disconnect to the house.

Fortunately, every piece of decent electronics and every computer in my house had already been shut off and unplugged earlier when I noticed the lights flickering. That said, I was keeping my fingers crossed that none of my smart switches were fried from all of the power flickering and subsequent brownout.

When the lineman was done, he came and turned our service back on at the panel and everything resumed working like normal. I thoroughly tested out every device in the house and was relieved that nothing was bricked. 

Moral of the story: always know where your main service disconnect is, and only buy smart switches that have air gap breakers. And, I suppose, don’t hesitate to call the utility  company when things are fishy with your service.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-23 02:51:00,In case you wanted to know what a smart home is like during a brownout...,"Our lights were intermittently flickering at our house today, so I called the utility company who sent somebody out at record speed to investigate.

Doggy door/treat dispenser,"I am looking for a doggy door and/or treat dispenser that I can tie into home assistant or hubitat or google home.

The big goals here are to be able to bring them inside whenever our gate opens,  if my cameras detect barking after a certain time of night, or if I know there is going to be someone working in the yard for some reason. Additionally I'd like to be able to lock the dog door from one of sides if the gate is open.  The really big thing is that I want to be able to unlock the door if a smoke alarm goes off.

"Purchase check, looking at getting a behind lightswitch WIFI/Zigbee Dimmer","Hi, I'm looking into getting a couple of [these](https://www.samotech.co.uk/products/wifi-switch-module/), I haven't decided on WIFI or Zigbee version yet but leaning to WIFI as it will be virtually next to the router and I have Hive heating and I don't think the hub is compatible.

I think I have checked everything but wanted to double check before I purchase.  I will need at least 2 for a [4 gang switch split into 3 gang dimmer and 1 gang (I think 2 way switch)](https://imgur.com/iCnD0AU). I'm in a new build so has a  neutral wire.

I assume can't wire up the on/off switch to the dimmer box, is this correct? I'm not worried about connecting the switch if not as it's not a light I use often (if at all).

Am I missing anything or have a covered all my bases and good to go?

Need advice on a WiFi and automation control for Daikin and Mitsubishi systems.,"After researching the subreddit, I've concluded that Sensibo is the recommended brand in automating my Mini Splits.

Background:
I have a mix of Daikins (2 Dual units) and Mitsubishi splits (2 Single zones):
MUZFH12NA - MSZFH12NA
MUZFH18NA - MSZFH18NA

3MXS24RMVJU---  CTXS07LVJU - FTXS12LVJU
5MXS48TVJU - (2) FTXS18LVJU


I didn't opt to have any WiFi mods to be installed when it was first installed.  

So, is the Sensibo system good to control 6 air handlers by two different brands?  And if so, what do I need to do to get it to work?  Do I need to buy several Sensibo systems?  Also, will I need to install wifi modules to 6 air handlers??

Home automation - What is resistive and what is incandescent load?,"I am in the process of replacing my in-floor heating switch to something that I can automate and control remotely. This is in a very small bathroom and the heating element must not be bigger than 4 by 3 feet, so I'm not too concerned about a max. rating of 600W, I think this should be plenty. 


The original installed manual switch/dimmer was rated as ""incandescent only 600 watt max."" - but the load was resistive! I assume it worked fine for years before I bought the house. Resistive load vs. incandescent load?


I replaced it by a programmable switch that was 1800W capable because I wanted to automate its function.


But now I'm thinking about putting in a Z-Wave switch that I can control from my home automation system.


It's just not clear to me what the difference is between an incandescent load and a resistive load since the original was designed for incandescent only loads but it was controlling underfloor heating element which, by definition, is resistive.


What is resistive and what is incandescent in my mind they're both the same?

"Everything Z wave for unity or fancier WiFi (thermostat, doorbell, garage)","Hello, I'm planning on outfitting my house with a Qolsys IQ panel 2+ and thought it would be ideal to have everything controlled through one app and my panel. The problem I'm running into is that the best devices for thermostats and door bells seem to be wifi. I'm looking at the Eufy 2K bell and the Ecobee or Nest thermostat.

Does anyone have a z wave doorbell or thermostat and have some input on it? I think the main advantage besides app unity is the complex scenes I can create. I'd like to have my security system be able to turn down the HVAC when I leave and arm the system. It would be nice to use my IQ panel for doorbell display too instead of having to pull my phone out.

Another device I'm considering is the garage door opener. Chamberlain has the WiFi MyQ, or there is a zwave controller I could wire to a regular dumb opener. I could never get MyQ to work at my current place and you need good WiFi in your garage.

I get geofencing with a z wave thermostat. The main smart feature I want that is on the Nest is the weather detection. I think the Alarm.com control can maybe check the weather and adjust a z wave thermostat but I have found any confirmation of this.

Basically do I get the fanciest device (that is wifi) and end up fragmenting my system. Trying to see if features out weigh the connectivity.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-23 15:09:19,"Everything Z wave for unity or fancier WiFi (thermostat, doorbell, garage)","Hello, I'm planning on outfitting my house with a Qolsys IQ panel 2+ and thought it would be ideal to have everything controlled through one app and my panel.

"I don’t know anything about robot vacuums and would like to start somewhere; if anyone could point me in a specific direction, Please &amp; Thank You!","I was going to start comparing robot vacuums, but there are so many, I don’t know how to sort them all out.

Most importantly, My biggest concern is pet vomit and liquids. My cat tends to vomit liquid/food if he eats too fast and I don’t want vomit smeared everywhere, I’d rather it be ignored at the least.

Second, all this pet hair. I just rescued 2 cats for a total of 4 now, and my apartment is covered in cat hair webs. Also, my hair is about 36 inches long, so that hair too. 

My house is generally clean, except the floors; which are tile, area rugs and bathroom rugs. If I sweep, it tosses all the hair up for it to float around. Otherwise, besides hair, my floors include a good amount of kitty litter, cat toys and shoe laces. 

When using a standard cheap upright vacuum, I can get about 70% of the hair out of the rugs. When I use a dyson vacuum on high suction, it removes about 99% of the hair from my carpets and comforter.

Basically, I’d like the hair and litter to be removed, pet vomit to stay and it’s important that it actually cleans all of my floors vs just bumping into things and winging it or leaving patches behind.

If you feel a robot vacuum may not be for me, I would appreciate that recommendation as well, and I will simply get a nicer upright vacuum that treats carpet and tile floors and can be used on a comforter.

Question about the Nuki Smartlock Opener,"Hey guys, I have a question about the nuki opener.

Recommendation for Routine Trigger for Alarm,"I have an ADT wired system. I have screen-enabled Alexa devices throughout the house. I also have Wyze cams throughout the house. 

Alexa now has the ability to trigger any action you want in a routine via a customizable “text to trigger” command. 

I’ve tried this on things like “when motion sensor detects motion between XYZ times, show me the living room”. And now I can see right from my nightstand the living room every time there’s motion at night. It’s great. 

I want to extend this to my ADT alarm. When the alarm goes off, BOTH Alexa Guard AND the Wyze alarm detection feature will be triggered. I want this to also trigger a camera feed of my front door or foyer, however the Wyze alarm detection can’t currently trigger an Alexa routine nor can guard alerts. 

Any ideas how to achieve this? I can’t think of a way that a virtual switch or sensor would be helpful here.

How to Automate (Steam) Heat for Small Apartment Building,"1. 4 Floors

Trying to change the 'dumb' circuit configuration of my room without burning a hole in my wallet,"I would like to change the my current WFH office space lighting layout without investing too much.

Smart Z-Wave heating thermostat,"Hello! I'm in the process of designing a complete system for my house and decided to go for a Fibaro Home Center 3 with Fibaro dimmers &amp; switches for most things.

Wifi Lights keep going offline,"I'm hoping someone can help me figure this out. I installed four Bazz Smart Home 4"" Smart Wi-Fi RGB LED Recessed Light Fixtures in the overhang on the front of my house. Every time I get all four lights online they will work perfectly for a short time (about 10 minutes) but then one of them will go offline and not come back online until I do multiple resets of the lights. I have removed the lights from the connection several times deleted the data on them and this keeps happening. I repositioned the junction boxes and even changed out several of the lights. Still I can't seem to get all four of them to stay online consistently. For Wi-Fi I have two Google Nest AC2200 Mesh Wi-Fi Routers (2nd Generation). One is plugged into the modem in my basement and one is upstairs about 15 feet from where the lights are. The Wi-Fi signal is strong on my phone standing near the lights so I'm not sure why they aren't staying connected.   Could this be due to a setting on my Wi-Fi network?

Object detection with alerts,"Hey all! I've got an idea of what I want to accomplish, and was hoping to get some advice on where to get started.

My objective is pretty simple. We keep a puppy pad in a particular room in case our puppers has to go and we are not around to let them out. If we forget to replace the pad, they will simply go on the floor where it would have been. I've been thinking it would be nice to set up an IP cam to detect if a puppy pad is *not* on the floor and alert me so I can replace it asap.

As an object it's fairly simple, it's the classic puppy pad. White square with a blue border. Sometimes they do get folded or otherwise altered to they aren't a perfect square anymore. I imagine Machine Learning of some kind would be useful in this case.

What I have already:
HomeKit ( most of my automation are in homekit )
HomeBridge
HomeSeer ( mostly to bridge z-wave and zigbee devices to homebridge )
Hue
Aqara ( no longer using, but I've been meaning to pull it out and dust it off. HomeSeer doesn't support many Aqara devices yet )
IP cams ( I've got a Wyze ip cam, and some older Amcrest low-def cameras )

Any thoughts?

What robot vacuum should I buy? Roborock S6 MaxV or room a i7?,"Hello dear redditers.
I recently bought very own apartment, and I wanna buy a robot vacuum cleaner, because om lazy and I'd rather do as little home cleaning as possible.

It seems that the S6 is a little better, because it cleans, and according to a review that I read it has a small camera that will help it not eat wires and other small objects.

How ever the roomba also seems like a food deal, and it's on black Friday sale. So which one would you recommend?

Thermostat to trigger underfloor heating waterflow pump,"I have underfloor heating, and the pump that secures the water flow on the underfloor heating is running 24x7. 

I have a Nest Thermostat V3 and was wondering if there is any way to get the pump to turn on, only when the Nest gives a trigger to start heating. This would have to be somehow wireless because the pump and the Nest thermostat are on different rooms, so I was thinking that maybe I could use a Shelly relay.

Anyone has any idea how to pull this off?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-22 20:33:25,Thermostat to trigger underfloor heating waterflow pump,"I have underfloor heating, and the pump that secures the water flow on the underfloor heating is running 24x7.

Ring floodlight camera vs separate motion sensor lights and an outdoor camera,"I am looking to add a floodlight security camera to my front porch. I found a ring floodlight camera, but it seems like a pain to install (since I don’t have wiring going to the location).

Will I compromise on any features of ring floodlight camera if I go with such a setup?

Need Advice on LED project and more,"Hey guys, first of all, I don't know much about home automation and LED, although I do have some very basic knowledge in electronic. I'm not even sure I'm in the right place but I saw a few posts here about LEDs so I guess you guys can help me a little bit. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm not sure what info I should provide.

I'm currently trying to build my own living room furniture. It's composed of 3 pieces: a multimedia cabinet with 6 shelves for my gaming consoles (ps4 &amp; ps5, XB1 and XBX and a switch), a TV stand with 3 shelves, where the bottom shelf will be a giant cable box with a built-in rackmount and the middle shelf will host my A/V receiver and finally a table with those nice looking epoxy ""river"" in the center.  


I want to wire some LED in there. I plan on having 5 different setup:

1. Each shelf of the multimedia cabinet will be lit up according to the console it host (red for nintendo, blue for playstation and green for xbox). Each shelf is 24""x24"" so a little less than 60 inch of LED per shelf, times 5 (the top shelf won't have any) for a total of approx 300"" inch of LED.
2. The central post of the multimedia cabinet (aka the cable hider) will contains 2 strips of 60"" LED, for a total of 120"". These LED will light up according to which HDMI source is selected
3. Another strip of LED behind the TV, hooked to the HDMI source so they light up according to the TV image. I plan on buying a 65"" TV sometime in the future so approximately 250"" of LED
4. Another strip of LED on the 2nd shelf of the TV stand where the A/V receiver will be. The TV stand is 24"" x 60"" so I'll need 150"" of LED
5. Finally, some LED in the epoxy ""river"" of the table. I'm still unsure of the dimension of the table, but I guess 100"" of LED would be enough

So for the multimedia cabinet, we're looking at 420"" of LED, for the TV stand it should be around 400"" and 100"" for the table, for a total of 920"" of LED. Is that too much?

Not that being said, I want to be able to control those LED remotely and change the color at will. Even more, I want to be able to program light show and stuff like that, even on the LED behind the TV and in the table. I have a strong programming background so this shouldn't be too much of an issue.

I made a lot of research in the past few days and I'm not not quite sure if I got everything right. I will probably have a different power supply per piece of furniture (so 3 total). 

For the multimedia cabinet, I will put a 5V-300W power supply and hook each shelf and the central post independently as to never exceed the limit of 200"" LED strip. I guess I will need something similar for the TV stand. For the table, a smaller power supply should be enough.

To control all those LEDs, I plan on hooking them to an ESP32 with a Raspberry Pi 4 as the central computer, so that I can easily switch mode with my phone (I'll probably build some website or an app to do it). I guess I would need 3 ESP32, one for each furniture.

The Pi4 will also be used to switch HDMI source (will should allow me to light the central post according to which HDMI source is selected) as well as probably a bunch of undefined stuff

Here's the list of material I plan to buy:

LED Setup:

* 5x LED strip: [https://www.alitove.net/product/ws2812b-300wh-np/](https://www.alitove.net/product/ws2812b-300wh-np/)
* 2x Power Supply 5v-300W: [https://www.alitove.net/product/5v-60a-t/](https://www.alitove.net/product/5v-60a-t/)
* 1x Power Supply 5v-25W: [https://www.alitove.net/product/5v-5a-bk/](https://www.alitove.net/product/5v-5a-bk/)
* 3x ESP32 micro controller: [https://www.amazon.ca/KeeYees-Development-Bluetooth-Microcontroller-ESP-WROOM-32/dp/B07QCP2451](https://www.amazon.ca/KeeYees-Development-Bluetooth-Microcontroller-ESP-WROOM-32/dp/B07QCP2451)
* LED Cover: [https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/diffuseur-transparent-transparente-aluminium-lumineuse/dp/B07KC8P2KD](https://www.amazon.ca/-/fr/diffuseur-transparent-transparente-aluminium-lumineuse/dp/B07KC8P2KD) (just to make sure this is fine to do this, apparently heating can be an issue??)
* HDMI Sync Box: [https://www.amazon.ca/Philips-Hue-555227-Splitter-Required/dp/B086ZJLCTW](https://www.amazon.ca/Philips-Hue-555227-Splitter-Required/dp/B086ZJLCTW)

Cable box &amp; rackmount:

* 1x Raspberry Pi 4: [https://www.amazon.ca/CanaKit-Raspberry-Starter-Kit-8GB/dp/B08DHC7KG8](https://www.amazon.ca/CanaKit-Raspberry-Starter-Kit-8GB/dp/B08DHC7KG8)
* The HDMI switch with RS232 port for remote control [https://www.amazon.ca/TESmart-Enterprise-Control-Rackmount-Keyboard/dp/B07MJGPJN2](https://www.amazon.ca/TESmart-Enterprise-Control-Rackmount-Keyboard/dp/B07MJGPJN2)
* The power bar: [https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B072RC5NZQ](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B072RC5NZQ)
* Network switch: [https://www.custom-integration-solutions.com/store/cis-80mk1-1u-rack-mount-wireless-vpn-router/](https://www.custom-integration-solutions.com/store/cis-80mk1-1u-rack-mount-wireless-vpn-router/) (not sure about that one but the built-in WiFi looks pretty cool, although I might use a classic switch with a separate wifi access point if it cost too much)

I'm not sure the Philips Hue sync box is compatible with the LED I choose. I wouldn't mind having a different set of LED for that and not hook them on the Pi4 like the other one.

Does that make sense? Is it possible? Am I missing something?

New Home Build - Diving back into automation,"Hello all,

The wife and I are building our first house and I want to dive deeper into home automation like I used to be a few years back in our current house. I used to have HomeSeer running on a server in my house tied to a GE Concord 4 Security system roughly 8 years ago. Currently, we have a bunch of smart wifi devices (smart bulbs, and receptacles) which are cloud based and also a bunch of Google Home speakers. Picked the majority of them up from a local wholesale/discount store. 

My primary automation objectives are as follows:

1. Smart Dimmer/Switch rockers in most rooms. Zwave or Caseta. Concerned about reliability and quality. Lot's of mixed opinions regarding z-wave switches (GE, Honeywell, Homeseer, Zooz). Lutron's Caseta looks to be top notch. 
2. Smart Speakers. I see HomeSeer allows for direct voice control from Google Home. We'll reuse the ones we currently have.
3. Security System integration. Looking at the Qolsys IQ 2+. Found that the IQ and the HS server can be Primary/Secondary Zwave Controllers. May need to confirm/test this before diving in.
4. I'm sure there will be receptacles that need integrated as well. Possibly Zwave.
5. We are going to have a 1000ft long driveway. Plan on putting in a driveway sensor in the ground and tie that into HomeSeer to trigger lights to turn on. Google TTS/Push Notification HS4.
6. Motion Devices for different light triggers.
7. Flood light integration for outside. If security system is tripped (in alarm) turn on all outside lights.
8. Some sort of HVAC integration. House will have a ClimateMaster or Bosch geothermal. Need to figure out the integration point. Modbus will be available. 
9. Future Sprinkler support via HomeSeer. Probably will do this via Modbus as well using a cheap PLC. 
10. Door locks on exterior doors will be Schlage FE599NX Z-Wave. Deadbolts where applicable to be Schlage Z-Wave. 

I need some help narrowing down a few items:

1. Im 90% sure that I want HomeSeer to be the main automation engine. Highly considering purchasing the HomeTroller PRO for a standalone device. Any concerns with the HomeTroller handling the item's above. 
2. I am really nervous to purchase 20-30 zwave or caseta switches. Having no experience with them; I am worried about reliability. It seems there is a lot of failures of the zwave type shortly after the warranty expiration. I know the caseta switches require a pro hub. Thoughts regarding reliability and us leaning towards caseta??
3. For flood lights. I like motion's, but also the ability to force them on/off. Is the best bet to use z-wave for this? I also like the flood lights that are always on but dim when no motion.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-23 04:04:05,New Home Build - Diving back into automation,"Hello all,  The wife and I are building our first house and I want to dive deeper into home automation like I used to be a few years back in our current house.

Video intercom suggestions?,"Hi all! I just moved into a detached house (Europe) with an old intercom system that doesn't work (wired from the gate to the house) .

I intend to start planning some smart additions to the house in the near future but I have security concerns regarding having everything connected to the internet so I'll probably work on some kind of local network for all devices that I'll have.

As this intercom thing is kind of urgent, I would like to know if you have any suggestions that could be compatible with my near future ideas for a video intercom with possible integrations with opening the gate and turning on lights and such... 

Would it be wiser to have the intercom capable of these integrations or later work on a home assistant automation feature that handles everything and save more on the intercom? I would really want to not go over the 200€ on this..

Debugging deconz,"I have some problems with my Deconz setup with lights reacting very slowly to turning on/off commands. This happens when using battery operated switches and apps (Home Assistant/Phoscon/Hue Essentials)

&amp;#x200B;

**My setup:**

\- RaspBee connected to a Raspberry 3B+ in my living room (central in my appartment and very close to several lightbulbs), Deconz Addon in Home Assistant, firmware is up to date ( 26390500 )

\- 16 device which can act as routers (bulbs, lightstrips, drivers...) from Hue, Tradfri, Gledopto, Müller tint, Osram

\- 26 battery powered devices (Aqara switches, Aqara motion sensors, Aqara tempereature sensors, 1 Hue motion sensor, 2 Hue remotes, 2 tradfri remotes

\- only 2 lights are controlled by a remote group in deconz (hue, tradfri remote), these usually respond quickly to presses

\- as the Aqara switches don't support remote groups they are controlled through node red or via rules  (button events) written to deconz using Hue Essentials toggling the lights on button presses

&amp;#x200B;

**Problems:**

\- sometimes lights react very slow (usually between milliseconds to 3seconds, seldom ots up to 10)

\- some messages seem to get lost completely

\- some messages need that long that we press a button twice, then both arrive shortly one after another so the light toggles twice

\- here is my deconz view:

How many smart 3 way switches do you need in the loop?,"I have been doing a lot of reading before switching out some 3way switches and am reading mixed opinions.

But I am still wondering what the best course of action would be. 

* If I install only 1, will the smart switch know if the light is on/off even if it doesn't know what the dumb switch has done? Or will it just flip the switch regardless of if it is on or off?
* If I install 2 do the 2 switches act as one unit in the app?

I put a commercial building automation system in my new house.,"I'm hoping this can stay here.  I see a lot of folks trying to cobble together many different technologies in this sub reddit, in an effort to do some pretty cool stuff.  But its stuff that in the commercial Building Automation world, that would be dead simple and just the start.  Unfortunately those abilities come at a price, and work with things almost never found in your house. In other words, it can be really expensive.

Full disclosure, I am a Building Automation Systems contractor, and I have been in the business for over 23 years.  I am keeping this post vendor/brand neutral as possible, as I do sell and install these types of systems for a living, and it seems like promoting one of those here would be in bad faith.   Truth is, that all the major manufacturers have similar capabilities.   I also have never even looked at anything like home kit, as the current state of home automation me to be a tedious, half assed mess.  I did do some lights in the past with a Mi Casa verda Vera Zwave controller, but I gotta say i was not impressed.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I own a small farm that had a 100 year old farmhouse, that unfortunately had fatal structural flaws.  Since it was coming down with or without our help, we decided to tear it down and build a new one.

After a couple of decades in Energy Management, HVAC, and Project development and management, I decided that I would put a commercial grade Building Automation system.  Installing a system like this would probably cost around $30K retail, but remember I am a dealer so the parts I got at wholesale, and I did a lot of the work myself.  I have not added up what I spent, as its hard to cleanly  separate all the costs.

I also insisted on some commercial concepts with the HVAC system mostly, and some electrical.

My builder was completely on board with this.  His HVAC contractor was not.  I should have fired him several times.  He was an idiot, and I work with loads of commercial mechanical contractors that would have cut me a nice deal to do my house.  But the builder wanted to use ""his guy"".   He also wanted to use his electricians, but I fired them three days in for very good reasons.  I was able to bring in my own contractor that had a full understanding of what I was trying to accomplish.

Anyway, the thing with the HVAC system that blew the contractors mind is that I ducted the heat pumps  together and used zone dampers to be able to send the heating or cooling from any heat pump to any part of the house.    This has several advantages.  Since I have two different sized heat pumps, I can match the most appropriate heat pump to the load. I also can equalize the run time they accumulate. Most importantly, if one dies, I do not lose heating or cooling to any part of the house.

I put a hot water heating coil in the common supply as well.  I have a combi boiler that does both my hot water and also has a heating loop that I can trigger with my system.   I have full control of both the hot water recirc loop and the heating loop.

The electric strip heat for the heat pumps is still there in case all else fails. I hope to never use it.

My house is divided into four zones, that have modulating dampers.    In commercial buildings this type of system is referred to as a ""VVT""  or a pressure dependent system.  Pressure dependent systems  are old technology, and quite frankly are not really installed that much anymore for good reason.   They are however cheap, and for my house, it was a good application.    The system keeps track of the active set point in the space and adjusts to keep the temperature stable in the zone.  The system keeps track of the zone needs and responds appropriately to keep both the zones and the heat pumps happy.

I used flow, temperature, and humidity sensors to calculate the realtime BTU performance of the heat pumps, and to alert me by text when one starts to slip too far.

I have six ""sensor nests"" through out the house that can tell me all kinds of things including temperature, humidity, light levels, sound levels, and occupancy. They also have RGB light rings that I can use to have the system communicate status or anything else I want.  In addition, there are two touch space temperature sensors that users can use to interact and display suystem info, as well as a larger touchscreen in the kitchen.

The screen shots in the imgur link show a web based interface that is actually hosted by my company, so that I can access the system from anywhere.

There are four programmable controllers (DDC) in the system, that communicate using a standard called BACnet. (ASHRAE 135 if you're really bored.)  BACnet is a very popular communications protocol in the industry.

What's not shown?  I have two doors with fingerprint readers so that I and my family are never locked out.  I'm registering some trusted friend as well, with the caveat that the system will log them using their fingerprint to enter, and it will text me immediately when they do.   I also have an Enocean wireless  hub, to do lighting controls next.

Questions?  I'm here.  ask me anything.

year old farmhouse that unfortunately had fatal structural flaws Since it was coming down with or without our help we decided to tear it down and build a new one After a couple of decades in Energy Management HVAC and Project development and management I decided that I would put a commercial grade Building Automation system Installing a system like this would probably cost around $30K retail but remember I am a dealer so the parts I got at wholesale and I did a lot of the work myself I have not added up what I spent as its hard to cleanly separate all the costs I also insisted on some commercial concepts with the HVAC system mostly and some electrical My builder was completely on board with this His HVAC contractor was not I should have fired him several times He was an idiot and I work with loads of commercial mechanical contractors that would have cut me a nice deal to do my house But the builder wanted to use his guy He also wanted to use his electricians but I fired them three days in for very good reasons I was able to bring in my own contractor that had a full understanding of what I was trying to accomplish Anyway the thing with the HVAC system that blew the contractors mind is that I ducted the heat pumps together and used zone dampers to be able to send the heating or cooling from any heat pump to any part of the house This has several advantages Since I have two different sized heat pumps I can match the most appropriate heat pump to the load I also can equalize the run time they accumulate Most importantly if one dies I do not lose heating or cooling to any part of the house I put a hot water heating coil in the common supply as well I have a combi boiler that does both my hot water and also has a heating loop that I can trigger with my system I have full control of both the hot water recirc loop and the heating loop The electric strip heat for the heat pumps is still there in case all else fails I hope to never use it My house is divided into four zones that have modulating dampers In commercial buildings this type of system is referred to as a VVT or a pressure dependent system Pressure dependent systems are old technology and quite frankly are not really installed that much anymore for good reason They are however cheap and for my house it was a good application The system keeps track of the active set point in the space and adjusts to keep the temperature stable in the zone The system keeps track of the zone needs and responds appropriately to keep both the zones and the heat pumps happy I used flow temperature and humidity sensors to calculate the realtime BTU performance of the heat pumps and to alert me by text when one starts to slip too far I have six sensor nests through out the house that can tell me all kinds of things including temperature humidity light levels sound levels and occupancy They also have RGB light rings that I can use to have the system communicate status or anything else I want In addition there are two touch space temperature sensors that users can use to interact and display suystem info as well as a larger touchscreen in the kitchen The screen shots in the imgur link show a web based interface that is actually hosted by my company so that I can access the system from anywhere There are four programmable controllers DDC in the system that communicate using a standard called BACnet ASHRAE 135 if you're really bored BACnet is a very popular communications protocol in the industry What's not shown I have two doors with fingerprint readers so that I and my family are never locked out I'm registering some trusted friend as well with the caveat that the system will log them using their fingerprint to enter and it will text me immediately when they do I also have an Enocean wireless hub to do lighting controls next Questions I'm here ask me anything ​ ​

Seeking Smart Ceiling Fan advice,"I’ve been searching on Amazon for a smart Ceiling fan for quite sometime now.

Can I install z wave dimmer module at the light instead of at the switch?,"I have four lights on a single switch. I want to be able to dim only one of them.

Which Wi-Fi system should i go with (bought eero but having issues)?,"I wanted to upgrade to a mesh system.

I can go with the Netgear Orbi 3 pack from Costco for $70 off making it $429, or maybe I shouldn't go mesh and just get a TP-Link archer 11000, also Costco, for $100 off making it $299.

Have a bit of an odd use case for a smart thermostat.,"As winter is coming up, I’m looking to close up the underside of a camper I have permanently parked at some property.

It has access to WiFi and electric 24/7 so no worries there.

Basically what I would like is to have a thermostat in the crawl space under the camper that can activate a heater under the camper when the temperature drops bellow a certain point and turn it off when it gets high enough. 

Also ideally, I would like to be able to have power permanently running to the thermostat, but be able to switch the power to the heater on and off. Any advice on what to look for would be appreciated.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-21 16:33:30,Have a bit of an odd use case for a smart thermostat.,"As winter is coming up, I’m looking to close up the underside of a camper I have permanently parked at some property.

Need help choosing a robot vacuum cleaner,"My mom decided she wants a new robot vacuum cleaner. She wants one that is relatively quiet ~60db and that also has the mopping function.

She found an offer for a Mamibot EXVAC660 ([link](https://www.mamibot.com/exvac660)) and she thinks it's a good offer because it's on a discount priced at 250€ (down from 500€). I disagree because that's usually just a gimmick to get you to buy on a _discount_ and also I've never heard of this company so I don't know how good they are.

I did a bit of research myself and I've come across 360 S7 Pro (I could get it on Amazon for 350€) and also Xiaomi 25012 Mi Robot Vacuum Mop Pro (also for around 340€).

Shelly rgbw2 not retaining setting,"I recenty bought a Shelly RGBW2 to control my rgbw lightstrip. As this is the only smart device I have I don't have a Home Assistant server or something and because it's more repsonsive I control the Shelly with Tasker directly, sending HTTP requests when I want to change brightness/colour.

It works great, just what I wanted, but when sending a request to turn on just the RGB part of the strip and at low brightness (just the red channel at 10% brightness for example) the lights stay on for about 30 seconds to 1 minute and then turn off (or change to last valid setting, I guess. The Shelly is set to return to last state when losing power. This makes me think that the Shelly restarts after receiving the HTTP command. I shoul probably note that when this happens the local Shelly address becomes unresponsive).

Checking on the local shelly address, when setting high brightness via HTTP request the sliders change on the site, but on lower brightness they don't. This problem is solved by doing a factory reset but comes back after 14 days or so. 

Does anyone have any idea why this would be happening? Could it be a power supply issue or is the Shelly configured wrong, somehow?

Smart Curtains/blinds help?,"Hey guys, I'm starting to look into curtains and blinds, there are a lot of options so I'm a little confused, doesn't help that I have no experience in traditional curtains and blinds, let alone smart ones... so I'm wondering what the order of installation is?  


Like do I start with installing traditional curtains and make it smart afterwards? or do I need to get smart motors/rails then install curtains afterwards?  


For curtains I'd like to have day (sheer) curtains + a night curtain to actually block out the sun if needed.  


For smarts, I'd like to control both with Alexa (IE: Alexa open day curtains/night curtains) and preferably be able to set a schedule for automated opening/closings.

Best contact and motion sensors for home assistant?,"Looking for the best (cheap) motions sensors and (7) contact sensors that work with home assistant. I currently have a pretty small smart home set up, but I'm looking to expand. 

Right now I have an Ikea tradfri set up, with a few bulbs, gateway and remote. I also have a bunch of wifi enabled plugs, a switch, and led strips (Kasa, or Tuya compatible). I have some Wyze products as well, including a couple cameras and the scale. I do have several Alexa based devices including the echo plus (which I'm using as a zigbee hub), I haven't attempted to add into home assistant yet, but it's on the list. Attached to the plus I have 3 hue bulbs, but I'm looking to switch everything over to a cheaper alternative, most likely ikea or wyze (or if you have another suggestion). My wyze products are not attached to home assistant either at this point (also on my to-do list.)

So should I go with sensors from Ikea or Wyze, or should I go with a cheaper aliexpress alternative? My ultimate goal is to create a 100% automated light system. Especially at night, I'd like the lights to turn on from the hallway to the bathroom at only a fraction of their brightness. I'd also like everything to go off if no one is home or in the room.

On another note, I'm very new to home assistant. so preferably something thats easily integrated would be ideal.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-20 20:51:17,Best contact and motion sensors for home assistant?,"Looking for the best (cheap) motions sensors and (7) contact sensors that work with home assistant.

Hue - Any way to make smart lights less dumb? How to automate ‘away state’ without geofencing?,"Hi guys, I just got my first few Hue bulbs and a Hue bridge and thought it’d be smooth sailing from here. Turns out the Hue Bridge doesn’t seem that powerful as I was led to believe. I’ve been playing around how to set up my ‘away’, but I do not really appreciate geofencing. With me, my wife, parents, in-laws and potential babysitters, it’s an awful lot of phones to keep maintained/installed. Are there any other ways to do this? 

I am quite confident I could trigger an IFTTT via a SmartThings plug in combination with my home alarm’s proprietary smart plug, but IFTTT doesn’t have any appropriate actions. So I’m running out of ideas. Has anyone tried anything similar?

Also, living in a house I want so start some lights based on the fact that I’m not home (and things like the HueLabs ‘TV mimicking’), while the Hue app only seem happy to turn things off... strange to me. I suppose I could solve this via iconnect hue, but then I’m back on geofencing.

Connectors for LED strips,"Hi all,

Isn't there any male-female connector ?

[example of how i need to connect them]   [link to wire kit]   If y’all have any questions, feel free to ask.",Can these wires be used on RGB Strips Looking to build an Infinity Cube but i need to cut the strips into two different piece for two sides on the cube Would this wires on 22AWG work on the rgb strips New to this and not familiar with wires so not sure if RGB Strips need specific wires or not I wont be using neopixels just normal generic rgb strips that require 4 wire connections instead of 3 example of how i need to connect them link to wire kit If y’all have any questions feel free to ask

Z-Wave / Homeassistant | Aotec USB stick and Multisensor won't connect,"Hi there,

I'm not new to Homeassistant but I am new to Z-Wave. I have a Aeotec Gen5 USB stick which is found fine by my Homeassistant docker. To test my first Z-Wave device I also got a Aeotec Multisensor 6.

Now I follow the guidelines, I click the 'Add node' button, then I press the button on my Multisensor. The blue led starts blinking as it should, but after a few seconds it turns red indicating that it couldn't find a network.

I've already factory resetted the Multisensor, but that didn't help. Here's the log from Homeassistant:

Looking to jump on the robotic vac bandwagon and looking for affordable recommendations,"Gearing up for Black Friday, I see quite a few of these have discounts on Amazon, John Lewis and Curry's. Was wondering what the consensus were with robot vacs – are they any good? Which brands/models should I avoid or focus on? Ideally budget is 100-200£, 300-400£ if it will make a significant cleaning difference. The home has wood, tile and rich carpet floorings.

Motion sensors... zigbee or z-wave?,"Up front, I have an established z-wave mesh with most rooms in the house having the GE z-wave or z-wave plus switches, fan controllers, and dimmers. I'm currently running smart things, but thinking of making the switch to hubitat and expanding automation, and I like the locality of hubitat. I don't have a huge house, single floor 1350 sq feet. I've read that zigbee sensors are a bit better from a response time standpoint, but I'm worried about not having an established mesh for that system. Are there cheap ways to establish a sufficient mesh network for zigbee when switches are already taken up by z-wave devices? Would z-wave motion zmsensors really be that much worse than zigbee?

The basics--What's the best iPhone HA app? (And what UIs should be avoided at all costs?),"Bonus points if it also runs on Android &amp; MacOS.

I am a neophyte to home automation. Stuff I've got:

* Dropcam (I stuck with it as it turned into Nest then Google Home).
* Nest thermostat. It wasn't the plan, but it came with the house.
* Wyze smart bulb (white tunable)
* Yeelight (color tunable)

I'm going to want lots of lighting. I might change the thermostat (I just don't like it). I may add more sensors. Probably smart switches and bulbs for sure. I'd like to be able to warm up the hot tub, do stuff if the garage door opens/close, do stuff around wake-up and beddy-by times.

The iPhone apps so far suck. Google's (consolidating all of the above) just ain't pretty. The stand alone apps for each device are okay, I suppose. Yeelight's is terrrible.

I want something that is great that I can us for everything even as I add more and more.

I don't ever want to use Alexa or talk to Siri in my home.

I have zero experience with Apple's HA stuff (though I am otherwise an Apple guy.)

While I'm considering Z-wave (and maybe HomeSeer, though I can be convinced to go another way), I *REALLY* want to make sure that whatever I do I can easily manage from my iPhone and spouse can do so from Android.

So, what are the great UIs and which ones should be avoided at all costs?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-20 03:26:43,The basics--What's the best iPhone HA app?

Is there a way to wirelessly sync 2 TV's to display the same image?,"I've seen this question asked a couple times, but never for wireless options.

A bit gluttonous I know, but I'd like the idea of cooking and moving between the kitchen / living room while seamlessly watching the same show / movie.

Re-use C4 amp with DIY solution?,"I've bought a house that had a legacy Control4 configuration, and I'm not interested in over-paying to upgrade the hardware or pay someone else to have access to my network and devices.

Questions concerning switching from Smarthings to Home Assistant.,"Looking for some insight on switching over a semi complex home automation setup from SmartThings  over to Home Assistant.  I currently have about 60 entities on my SmartThings setup, lights, light controllers, outlets, relays, wall switches, motion sensors, etc.  I also have Google Home integrated with thermostats, cameras and speakers throughout the house.  Currently the integrations work well and voice control is pretty smooth.

One of my main issues is that I have spotty Internet and SmartThings doesn't work well when I lose connection so I have been looking into Home Assistant for more local control.  I have been playing around with it for a couple of weeks trying to learn how to setup the dashboards, integrations and so on.  Long term I plan to get rid of Google as well but that is another issue I will deal with down the road. 

I purchased a  HUSBZB-1 zigbee/zwave controller to control my devices but have a few questions.  Right now I am not comfortable switching over completely as I am still a novice with Home Assistant, however I would like to start adding new devices directly instead of through SmartThings.  Can I add zigbee devices to the  HUSBZB-1 without creating issues with SmartThings zibee radio?  I understand Zwave is a little more complicated due to exclusions but am fine waiting a bit for that.  My WiFi is pretty stable even without Internet so I don't want to add a lot of unnecessary inference if it wont integrate properly.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-19 17:40:42,Questions concerning switching from Smarthings to Home Assistant.,"Looking for some insight on switching over a semi complex home automation setup from SmartThings  over to Home Assistant.

Can I add zigbee devices to the  HUSBZB-1 without creating issues with SmartThings zibee radio?  I understand Zwave is a little more complicated due to exclusions but am fine waiting a bit for that.  My WiFi is pretty stable even without Internet so I don't want to add a lot of unnecessary inference if it wont integrate properly.",Questions concerning switching from Smarthings to Home Assistant Looking for some insight on switching over a semi complex home automation setup from SmartThings over to Home Assistant I currently have about 60 entities on my SmartThings setup lights light controllers outlets relays wall switches motion sensors etc I also have Google Home integrated with thermostats cameras and speakers throughout the house Currently the integrations work well and voice control is pretty smooth One of my main issues is that I have spotty Internet and SmartThings doesn't work well when I lose connection so I have been looking into Home Assistant for more local control I have been playing around with it for a couple of weeks trying to learn how to setup the dashboards integrations and so on Long term I plan to get rid of Google as well but that is another issue I will deal with down the road I purchased a HUSBZB-1 zigbee/zwave controller to control my devices but have a few questions Right now I am not comfortable switching over completely as I am still a novice with Home Assistant however I would like to start adding new devices directly instead of through SmartThings Can I add zigbee devices to the HUSBZB-1 without creating issues with SmartThings zibee radio I understand Zwave is a little more complicated due to exclusions but am fine waiting a bit for that My WiFi is pretty stable even without Internet so I don't want to add a lot of unnecessary inference if it wont integrate properly

Separate power/input,"I'd like to install a smart switch that runs like a circuit breaker (as a simple manual switch does). It needs to have a separate input power to run its own components, from the input of the circuit it will be breaking. More specifically, I need to install this in a DC circuit of an elevator (some voltage I'm not sure of) where normal manual switch is working fine but a simple sonoff smart wifi switch won't work because we cannot have AC power output which switches tend to have.

Any produce suggestions or lines of enquiry welcome.

Soil temperature sensors?,"I'm baffled by the lack of options. I can find plenty of sensors to tell me the moisture level in the soil. I want the actual temperature. 

This determines when to apply pre-emergents, fertilizers, grass seed etc. 

In a perfect world, I'd have a sensor in the shade, and one out in the sun burried \~5 inches under the grass and far enough away from the house to avoid skewing the results. I'd have push notifications at a few specific temperature settings and the ability to import the data logs so I can build historical trends in Excel. 

Currently, I have concocted a  plan to simply take a cheap Govee sensor and place it in a 'stash can' meant for divers. It's the smallest, cheapest, waterproof container I could find that isn't metal and big enough to work. Any empty space would impact accuracy so I'm thinking I can just fill that space with dry play sand. The whole works then gets buried in the yard. 

We'll see if the signal can make it through a few inches of dirt.

How to control 868 Mhz RF devices from Homebridge or HomeAssistant?,"We have 14 blinds which are controlled by remotes. I would like to get them to work with either Homebridge or Home Assistant. We currently have HB working nicely with other devices, but are considering HA as it seems a lot more capable and flexible.

I originally thought the blinds might be running on 433 MHz, so tried out a Broadlink RM4 Pro, but it didn't work.

Using an RTL-SDR USB device, I've established that they are communicating via 868 MHz. I also know that the blinds are able to communicate back their current status, so the traffic must be two-way. (I don't imagine they are using rolling codes as they wouldn't pose a security threat.)

I could do all the RF hacker stuff and build myself a Pi-based thing to replicate the conversations, then write a HB plugin for it, but if there is another solution I would prefer not to reinvent the wheel.

Does anyone know if there's an RF-learnable or -configurable device available that works with HB or HA that can help me achieve this?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-19 16:10:22,How to control 868 Mhz RF devices from Homebridge or HomeAssistant?,"We have 14 blinds which are controlled by remotes.

GE/Jasco Z-Wave dimmer not working,"So I'm not sure if this is the correct sub, since is more electrical related but I'll give it a shot.  
I got a GE/Jasco Z-Wave Plus dimmer model 47338, I connected to my Hubitat hub, no issue so far.  I can see the dimmer changing status and level. I don't have a dimmable bulb on hand so I tried first with an incandescent bulb (these are supposed to be dimmable) but the bulb didn't even turn on (the state was changing in the Hubitat device page), then I tried with a led bulb, it is not dimmable but at least it should work with on/off. This is the opposite of the incandescent bulb, with the led switch it turns on and it stays like that. I tried to power off but it does not work. 

After more debugging I measure the voltage in the switch with the led bulb and there is practically 0V difference, so the switch is on, circuit is closed and no way to turn it off, so it makes sense the bulb is on, even if in Hubitat shows as off.  
And whit the incandescent is the opposite, the switch remains off, the circuit is open. So I don't know what's the difference with the two bulb. Why with one bulb the switch is perpetually on and with other off? Should I try another bulb? I even try switching the line and neutral wires but the same happens.   
Has anybody seen this behavior with this or other switches?

My zigbee sensor to WiFi bulb is too slow. Advice pls?,"I'm pretty new to this. My first project is to turn the bathroom light in when someone enters the room.

I'm running Home Assistant core, koenkk_zigbee2mqtt and eclipse_mosquitto as docker containers. I have a [cc2531 dongle](https://notenoughtech.com/news/get-cc2531-on-the-itead-store-instead/) with Zigbee2MQTT firmware. In terms of devices I have a TAPO wifi bulb and a Sonoff SNZB-03 zigbee motion sensor.

After some amount of effort, I got the bathroom light coming on as I came into the room. Success! Unfortunately, there's a two-second delay and that's enough time for someone to reach for the light switch, which will result in confusion.

I'm not sure where the delay is coming from. I'd guess the motion sensor rather than Home Assistant or the wifi bulb, but I might be wrong. At any rate, I'd like to try and reduce the two seconds. Would a door sensor be faster?

Advice appreciated.

Update 1: Swapping the Tapo bulb (uses cloud) for a Novastella bulb (flashed with Tasmota) reduced the time to 1.5seconds. I’m going to try another motion sensor.

Update 2: Swapping the Sonoff motion sensor for a Samsung SmartThings motion sensor reduced the time to about 0.2 seconds, so the Sonoff sensor was definitely the weak link. After this I swapped out my Zigbee USB and Zibgee2MQTT docker container and replaced them with a Tasmota-flashed Sonoff Bridge. It’s a slightly simpler system but the reaction times has crept up to about 0.5 seconds.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-18 22:20:40,My zigbee sensor to WiFi bulb is too slow.

Sonoff Devices wifi connection woes.,"I have a few Sonoff devices.  I struggle to get them to pair with wifi.  I'm looking for help.  

I am working with various iDevices running the ewelink app in my attempts to get them to recoginze my wifi network.  With 1 of my 6 devices, I was successful in connecting to it using the ""Compaitiblity"" option on ewelink app, where I connect to the ad-hoc network the device creates.  Since successfully setting up that one device, it works reliably.  The problem I have now that I can't get any of the others to work in a similar manner.  

I was able to see the ITEAD-1000xxxx network one of my parts announced once by looking for it with my Mac mini wifi connection, but by the time I was able to manually configure my iPhone to connect to that network, the cycle timed out, and I haven't been able to make it happen again.  

Any advice for how I can make these things announce their networks in a way that I can join them?

Buttons - How to track one's medication,"Equipment: SmartThings Hub and SmartThings Button

Connections: IFTTT and Google Sheets

I take a lot of medication unfortunately and I have short-term memory issues with the mundane part of my life turning off the coffee maker, taking pills, etc. I wanted a simple button that I can press at my medicine cabinet every time I take my medication. I'm supposed to take six different meds in the morning, one at lunch, and four before bed of eight different meds. SmartThings button has the one press, double press, one long press, options for 3 different tasks. I wanted to use this button to accomplish the following tasks:

1) google sheet tracking when I take my medication. So when I take my meds and then two hours later I question whether or not I took them I could check the excel sheet to see if there is a timestamp in there. Missing a dose or overdosing is super problematic and can cause me to miss a day of work.

2) email myself that I need to request a refill. I kid you not... I sometimes will be down to my last pill before remembering to order more. 

3) email myself to set up a doctor's appt. 

When I go to set up the button in IFTTT, IFTTT doesn't recognize SmartThings button as a button nor does it have it as an option as ""pressing the button.""

Would any of you savvy folks be able to assist me in this matter to make things simpler with my medication?

This way, if you leave a door be, it is closed. If you wish for it to remain open, simply latch it so. If the door is open when you want it closed, but aren't in the door's vicinity, simply pull out your phone or ask your assistant to close it. Voila.

I realize that this leaves out being able remotely OPEN a door, and that there are products on the market that will do this ALONG with closing the door, but they are quite the pretty penny.

(RF433/RFlink)PIR sensor sometimes doesn’t transmit.,"I’m having an occasional problem with some PIR sensors I bought, occasionally they outright refuse to send a message when triggered although the led lights up. I’m using them with an RFLink Nodo box which is in turn connected to HomeAssistant on a Pi.


At the point I’m seeing failure, other RF433 devices are transmitting ok.
 

Now I admit they weren’t very expensive as these go, [around £4 each on aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001070422027.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.6f0b4c4d86EJpv) but their range is very good and have an extendable antenna on each one - I confirmed it’s connected to the PCB electrically and not just there for show. I bought these to replace some Sonoff PIR sensors which exhibited the same behaviour.

 I’m just wondering if there could be any other reason for the occasional lack of RF than just  “cheap crap” and maybe a way to troubleshoot further.

Also, if anyone has a link to more expensive but known to be reliable PIR RF433 units it’d come in useful.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-19 02:43:05,(RF433/RFlink)PIR sensor sometimes doesn’t transmit.,"I’m having an occasional problem with some PIR sensors I bought, occasionally they outright refuse to send a message when triggered although the led lights up.

New Construction Wiring Consolidation Question,"I am building a new home and have the opportunity to plan out all of my LV wiring needs.  I've been learning a significant amount of information regarding LV wiring &amp; automation (thanks to this community) and so I've gone a bit overboard on my initial plans, or so I think.  My home will be approximately 5,000 square feet including the basement though not including a 3rd floor livable attic.  Right now I am at about 171 wiring points which include all home audio, video, security and other automation interests.  I included a picture that illustrates my wiring plans by room along with the first floor depicted.  In general, I am concerned wiring costs alone (cable and labor) is going to cost me upward of $20,000 though recognize this is a one-time opportunity to get the infrastructure done correctly.

My main questions below are related to finding opportunities to consolidate and/or reduce the number of wires in my current plans without compromising capability, but I also had a couple related question on Touchscreens and Soundbar vs. In-ceiling speakers.

1. Should I include Cat6 runs for both Voice Enabled Devices (e.g., Amazon dots in the ceiling) and Touchscreens or should I simply plan to have Touchscreens that support voice enabled commands thereby reducing Cat6 runs in the ceiling?
2. Similar to the question above, should I include wiring for sensors or are there touchscreens available that support sensing/motion and thereby reduce the need for separate motion sensors throughout the house?
3. Have I gone completely overboard?  Have I overlooked anything?
4. What Touchscreens provide the greatest user experience and flexibility (e.g., ability to control lighting, audio, etc.) while also having nice aesthetics.  I have been looking at different manufactured touchscreens (e.g., Savant) but I'm not sure I want to subject myself to a particular manufacturer and some lack flexibility.  For example, I really like HTD's Lync12 system, but I'm not crazy about their keypads since they are limited to audio only.  I am thinking the best and most flexible solution is to have wall-mounted iPad / Android devices that are running Home Assistant but curious how these devices will behave when they are not in use.  Can I configure iPads / Android devices to run Home Assistant by default (avoid the user from having to start the application) and do they wake up automatically when they sense nearby motion?  Ideally I want these devices defaulting to the application and making it easy for the end-user to adjust lights, play music, or control audio.  I also think iPads on the wall look bulky!
5. In my family room I am leaning towards a soundbar + 2 in-ceiling speaker setup primarily to enhance the TV/movie watching experience (direct sound from the TV area vs. sound coming the ceiling), though will it impact the audio listening experience when I want to simply have audio throughout the entire house (i.e., does audio coming from a hybrid combination of a soundbar and in-ceiling speakers feel awkward?).

In my family room I am leaning towards a soundbar + 2 in-ceiling speaker setup primarily to enhance the TV/movie watching experience (direct sound from the TV area vs. sound coming the ceiling), though will it impact the audio listening experience when I want to simply have audio throughout the entire house (i.e., does audio coming from a hybrid combination of a soundbar and in-ceiling speakers feel awkward?).

[LV Plan Detail - Excel File]   [LV Plan Legend - PPT File]   [Draft Wiring Plans by Room]   [1st Floor Wiring Plan] ",537,5,"New Construction Wiring Consolidation Question I am building a new home and have the opportunity to plan out all of my LV wiring needs.  I've been learning a significant amount of information regarding LV wiring & automation (thanks to this community) and so I've gone a bit overboard on my initial plans, or so I think.  My home will be approximately 5,000 square feet including the basement though not including a 3rd floor livable attic.  Right now I am at about 171 wiring points which include all home audio, video, security and other automation interests.  I included a picture that illustrates my wiring plans by room along with the first floor depicted.  In general, I am concerned wiring costs alone (cable and labor) is going to cost me upward of $20,000 though recognize this is a one-time opportunity to get the infrastructure done correctly.  My main questions below are related to finding opportunities to consolidate and/or reduce the number of wires in my current plans without compromising capability, but I also had a couple related question on Touchscreens and Soundbar vs. In-ceiling speakers.  1. Should I include Cat6 runs for both Voice Enabled Devices (e.g., Amazon dots in the ceiling) and Touchscreens or should I simply plan to have Touchscreens that support voice enabled commands thereby reducing Cat6 runs in the ceiling? 2. Similar to the question above, should I include wiring for sensors or are there touchscreens available that support sensing/motion and thereby reduce the need for separate motion sensors throughout the house? 3. Have I gone completely overboard?  Have I overlooked anything? 4. What Touchscreens provide the greatest user experience and flexibility (e.g., ability to control lighting, audio, etc.) while also having nice aesthetics.  I have been looking at different manufactured touchscreens (e.g., Savant) but I'm not sure I want to subject myself to a particular manufacturer and some lack flexibility.  For example, I really like HTD's Lync12 system, but I'm not crazy about their keypads since they are limited to audio only.  I am thinking the best and most flexible solution is to have wall-mounted iPad / Android devices that are running Home Assistant but curious how these devices will behave when they are not in use.  Can I configure iPads / Android devices to run Home Assistant by default (avoid the user from having to start the application) and do they wake up automatically when they sense nearby motion?

First robot vacuum: 360 S9 vs Roborock S5 Max,"Hi. I am looking to purchase one of these as my first robotic vacuum. They are both more or less the same price right now for me. I will use it for a mixture of hard floor and low pile carpet.

Best Smart Switch Options For Me,"Hello Everyone!

I recently moved into my first own house and am excited to get started on the automation journey. Until now, I have been using smart bulbs in my previous house but now I want to get to smart switches so it is easy for anyone visiting to be able to still use the lights and fans. I've read a lot of posts about recommendations but couldn't get a firm answer so was hoping you could guide me in the right direction.

I plan to automate majorly using Home Assistant and/or Homekit, I have some two way switches and some normal. Mostly lights but a couple of fans. Below are my constraints sorted in priority order:

1. Not too expensive but willing to spend for less maintenance and longer life
2. Easy to install
3. Plays well with multiple ecosystems

Mi Home Temp Sensor - Bluetooth playing up with Home assistant,"Hey everyone,

Recently I accidentally managed to brake my bluetooth dongle which I had the sensor working with previously thanks to help in a previous thread so I decided I'd get a proper WiFi/Bluetooth card for my computer to replace it.

I've read further posts online of others having the same issue, the on board cards playing up but dongles working. Anyone have any ideas what's going on here?

I'm trying to re connect my Xaomi temp sensors. I noticed that going back to [https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html](https://atc1441.github.io/TelinkFlasher.html) it's able to connect to the sensor and get the key.

Automating Scenes Offline,"I have a pool pump that I am trying to automate so that when temps get near freezing the pump automatically goes on.  I purchased a ewelink zigbee hub and temp sensor, and the pump is on a sonoff smart plug.  Then I created a scene in ewelink that turn the pump on when the temp goes down.  So far so good.  Issue is that if the internet is down, the scene won't run.

I'm looking for a solution that will allow me to run the scene locally over wifi even when internet goes out.  What is a good solution, ideally that will work plug and play?

Home Assistant vs. Google Home?,"Hi All, I have seen some posts saying that Home Assistant is far superior to Google Home. But I can't quite figure out why. I even saw a couple of posts in this sub but they didn't get too much traction/dialogue.

I posed a question recently about 'vacation mode' for smart light bulbs - turning lights on and off at random times so it seems like someone is home. Is that the kind of ""control"" that you'd get through HA, but can't do through GH (except to a limited extent with routines)? I'm just not clear on the specific functionality I would gain through HA. Maybe it's just that I'm not creative enough with how to use my smart home devices...

Wall plugs that can dim LED lights?,"I live in an apartment and we have 3 floor lamps in our living room. In the past month I've purchased and returned like 4 different smart bulbs. They just aren't bright enough and we want to go back to our normal LED bulbs which are \~1500 lumen daylight bulbs. 

One thing I really want though is to be able to dim them, for when we watch movies at night. I saw someone mention that getting dimmer wall switches was the better option for bright lights, but living in an apartment I don't think swapping out switches is really an option

Amazon Echo Show or DIY?,"Hi Guys,

I am new to the whole topic of home automation, so bear with me if there are any mistakes or inaccuracies. My first actual use-case is quite simple: I want a few smartplugs that I can turn of when I leave my appartment. So I did some research about the protocols and networks and ended up with the decision that I want to start with a Zigbee Hub and those smartplugs. This might be quite the overkill for my use-case but as you all probably understand: I want some room for further automation and this seems a reasonable base for it.

When I was looking for the options for a Zigbee Hub I stumbled upon the ""Conbee II""-Stick. I like this option because it's a fairly good price and doesn't force me into proprietary hard-/software as other gateways might do.

Furthermore I got into programming lately and thought about building some kind of weather station/smartmirror/info screen based on a raspberry pie.

You see where this is going: I am planning on fusioning this projects. But since I am still lacking the overview about both topics I am asking you guys for some help.

The options I want to decide between are:

a) Getting an Amazon Echo Show for around 200$ on Black Friday and use this as my Zigbee Hub.

* pros: 
   * it works and is comfortable
   * all the advantages and functions I get with an Echo
* cons:
   * I don't have any fun building it.

b) Building my own info tablet/weather station/zigbee hub by buying a raspberry, a screen for the rasp and the ConBee, which is also around 200$ and run Alexa on it.

* pros: 
   * I might have a lot of fun building it and will learn a lot from it
   * I can stick the Conbee in any other device and still have a working hub while I use the other hardware for any other purpose
* cons: 
   * I might end up without anything but a big pile of expensive hardware because things got way to hard and time consuming for me.
   * Additional hardware might be required (e.g. mic and speaker for Alexa service etc.) and the project will get unreasonable expensive

&amp;#x200B;

What I need your help with is: 

* Is option b) actual possible?
* Can you tell me which limitations either option has that I might regret later? 
* Am I better off with separating my projects and enjoy the the comfort of a working home automation base and some programming on a Pie?

Sonoff or similar safe for in-wall/in-attic? Or other option for switchless lights.,"I'm trying to find a solution for a hallway.

It looks like my options now are something like the Sonoff but I've read some posts where people say they wouldn't trust them in-wall let alone left in an attic primarily due to the lack of UL/ETL listings.

Video doorbell but with a twist,"Hi everyone, apologizes if this isn't the right sub for this.

I'm researching something for work, and it's left me scratching my head. Essentially, we have a front reception desk in our lobby, and normally, when the receptionist takes a lunch break, someone else comes down to cover the lunch shift. Well, with COVID, they don't want two people sharing a desk area (even not at the same time).

So, I've been tasked with finding a way for someone to ""virtually cover"" the front desk. Their initial idea was to setup an iPad running Zoom and have a visitor use that to call people upstairs. I'm not a fan of this for multiple reasons, including ease of use, powering the iPad, and securing it so it can't be stolen.

Off the top of my head, my initial idea was using a camera with 2-way audio, like an Arlo camera. But I also would like some kind of way for a visitor to ""request"" someone, like a button they could push. That's when I thought of a video doorbell. However, I'm running into an issue: it seems like all the video doorbells are made to wire into an existing doorbell spot on a porch. It looks like Arlo is coming out with a wire free one, but it's on pre-order.

**So my question is - is there a way to wire up a video doorbell to a standard wall outlet? Like some kind of an adapter?** Ideally I don't want to wait for the Arlo wire free doorbell to come out, and even if it was out, I'd rather wire something into an outlet instead of changing batteries all the time.

Or perhaps I'm even overthinking this - if anyone has another solution besides a video doorbell I'm all ears. Our budget for this is a few hundred dollars, let's just say $300-$450 range. **I would like a way for a visitor coming up to the reception desk to push some kind of button, and have that send a notification to people upstairs on PCs, who will then be able to have a conversation with this visitor at the reception while remaining at their PC**s (they have headsets).

WiFi Advice Needed. What tech do you use?,"Hello, I currently have a mesh Google Wifi system in my house. I have been sort of happy with it, but I could be happier. I have a two story house with a basement and have a puck  on each level. This may be overkill.  I believe I could get by with two access points. One in the basement where the office will be and one on the main level. 

The only things upstairs will be a few SmartTVs and cell phones. Sort of the same on the main level. We currently have our Alarm system on the main level but it can be relocated to the basement and I can add a wireless siren on the main level. 

In the basement, I have a few smart hubs, the alarm gateway and a NAS hardwired into a switch.

I have several Amazon Echos, smart tvs, smart hubs, etc. Probably 70 devices total that are connected to the Wifi/Hardwired. I dont have cat6 run anywhere in the house, but am not opposed to running it to have two hardwired APs. 

I would like to have three subnets. Main, Guest, IoT. I would like to wall off one port on a switch in order to  have my plugged in devices segregated and also be able to keep those on the same subnet as what is on the IoT wifi. I will have a piHole running on the network as well. What hardware would you recommend?

I have researched Ubiquity and thought that (2) [**UniFi nanoHD Access Point**](https://store.ui.com/products/unifi-nanohd-us) and (1) USW Flex Mini would do the trick. Any thoughts?

Is there a cool digital in-wall device I can use to control all of this so I can avoid using a clunky audio receiver in a cabinet? Alexa devices have been recommended to me but I’m not real clear on how that setup would work. For what it’s worth I prefer Google over Amazon if that’s an option.

Beginner learning Home Assistant: how to tell the motion detector to stop if someone pressed the light switch,"Hi guys. Continuing with my slow learning process for dummies, I have now successfully integrated two Zigbee devices to my Home Assistant, which work marvelously and make me happy. A wireless switch that toggles on/off a lamp and a wireless motion detector that turns on the lamp when detecting motion and turns it off if no motion is detected for 5 minutes. This is awesome already but perhaps I'd like to try a step further now.

What I'd like to achieve now is: if the lamp gets turned off through pressing the switch, I'd like the motion detector to stop turning on the lamp for X minutes (let's say 30 minutes) when detecting motion. However if the lamp gets turned on though pressing the switch, the motion detector should continue to work normally and turn off the lamp if no motion is detected for 5 minutes.

I'm just starting, so I feel I'm not ready for code yet. I've created these automations with the automation menu, or whatever it's called (what shows up when you click on ""skip""). So, if you think it's possible, I'd like to do this with this menu for now and not with code.

I just want to understand the logic. Maybe what I should do is set a condition for the motion detector: ""only do what you do IF the wireless switch didn't turn off the lamp for the past 30 minutes"". Or something like this, but I have no idea how to do this.",r/homeautomation,2020-11-16 23:29:01,Beginner learning Home Assistant: how to tell the motion detector to stop if someone pressed the light switch,"Hi guys.

Smart switches with smart bulb,"I've been given confusing advice and need to hear from people who know what they're talking about.

I was all set to buy Lutron Caseta switches but was warned that very few RGB bulbs are compatible with them (or perhaps not compatible with the the recessed light cans Lutron recommends). But on investigation it looks like RGB bulbs are generally smart bulbs, and combining smart bulbs with smart switches isn't smart. 

At the moment, we're doing a remodel, all the walls are open, and we can install whatever smart switches and whatever recessed cans we like. **Is there a good smart-switch to combine with RGB bulb**s (i'm okay with controlling the color and warmth from a bulb app -- doesn't need to be done through the switch)?

Sadly, I haven't been able to figure this out online. I'm good at learning things, but also humble enough to recognize that I might not even know the right questions or search engine terms to do a proper investigation.

For the record, before the remodel, I used Alexa to talk to Smartthings to talk to Cooper Aspire switches, and some outlets, and some Sengled bulbs -(Sengled bulbs hooked up to non-smart switches) so I'm not a complete newbie, but definitely no expert",r/homeautomation,2020-11-17 00:52:48,Smart switches with smart bulb,"I've been given confusing advice and need to hear from people who know what they're talking about.

Automated Film Studio?,"I work for a university and I've been tasked to develop a dead-simple, small video studio while we have downtime during the pandemic (it wouldn't be available until it's safe, of course).

This would ideally involve simple tasks like turning on the studio lights, camcorder, microphone, and signal processors with a single voice command. It would also be great if I can add limitations to the device so the students can't try to use the echo dot for any other purpose.

Bought a house! Need some insight.,"So I am definitely into home automation but not as intricate as most of you. My experience is “off brand” lighting and plug-in outlets that connect directly to WiFi. 

I am mainly looking for insight as to brands to use that won’t break the bank but work well. I did buy a Smartthings hub a few months ago with the assumption that most things are compatible with it, but I learned that was not the case. If I could utilize this, that would be great. I have looked on their website for compatibility but the list is long so I am overwhelmed by it. 

My concern is taking up too much of the WiFi bandwidth so I’m assuming universal hubs are important. 

I have multiple Alexa’s already so I would like to stick with that as much as possible but some cross compatibility with HomeKit would be nice. 

Also what I think would be really important would be products that can be controlled by switches/buttons so that my fiancé doesn’t always have to speak to Alexa and can just flip a switch. 

What I am looking for:
- Lighting (bulbs and strips)
- Outlets (built-in or plug-in)
- Security system
- Home monitoring system
- Speakers/sound system 
- Outdoor cameras
- Control panel
- Operating system
- Anything else you think is necessary 

Please note I am not super savvy (especially when it come to things like Raspberry Pi or other things where I have to “hack” the system).

RGB Ceiling Lighting with Wall Mounted Controller Panel,"Hello\~  


I am going to wrap my gaming room with these nice RGB tube lights I bought off Alibaba.

I bought one of the vendor recommended controllers as well and while it works, the app is chinese made and only works when using wifi direct and isn't ideal.  I know there are plenty of better controllers that would have a nice app, but I'm trying to see if I can get a little better than that.

My ideal setup would be to have a wall mounted touch panel that I could turn on the lights, change the color, and change preset scenes from in addition to using an app.  A bonus would be if I can integrate it to alexa and also turn on/off recessed smart lights im planning to install in the ceiling as but I'm not that worried about that.  I've seen wall panels such as [https://www.amazon.com/Mi-Light-Wall-mounted-Controller-Dimmable-Changing/dp/B01N9LFU9A/ref=sr\_1\_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=wall+mount+RGBW+touch+panel&amp;qid=1605560381&amp;sr=8-4](https://www.amazon.com/Mi-Light-Wall-mounted-Controller-Dimmable-Changing/dp/B01N9LFU9A/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=wall+mount+RGBW+touch+panel&amp;qid=1605560381&amp;sr=8-4) but i'm wondering if anyone here has a similar setup and what controller + panel they are using?

Confused on what smart smoke and CO detectors,"I am doing a remodel on a ranch house with an attic and crawlspace in SC in the United States. I'd like to have smoke and CO detectors throughout the house and be able to tell which alarm is triggered. I'd like to have them hardwired and for the alarm to work on battery backup too. Ideally I'd prefer to avoid Nest. I have Home Assistant with a Aeotec Z-stick Gen5 (Z-wave) and CC2531 Dongle (Zigbee). I also have a SmartThings hub too.

It's just my wife and I and a small dog. We have 3 bedrooms on one side of the house with a short hallway. One bedroom has its own small full bathroom, which is where we sleep. Right outside of that bedroom on the outside is the packaged HVAC unit with gas heat. In the hallway is another small full bath. The hallways leads to the living room which is where the front door is. The den is also off the hallway, and the dining room is connected to the living room. The kitchen is an open space with a gas range and the den area. 

The dining room connects to the kitchen as well. From the kitchen is a short set of stairs to a large bedroom with a full bath (FROG). This room is above the garage. In the garage, you go down a few stairs and there is a laundry room with gas water heater, garage area, and workshop area. The workshop we plan to make a small guest bedroom eventually. All bedrooms will have beds and potential guests. Most bedrooms are 12-16 feet on each side, but the FROG is quite large running almost 24 feet long.

I'm trying to figure out the best way to do this and what to buy.

1. Is there an all-in-one integrated solution? If so, do you have ballpark cost? I couldn't easily see the cost for the few I found like the one from Climax I read about here.
1. Should I get separate smoke and CO detectors or combined? I've read conflicting things on if a CO2 detector is better mounted down low vs the ceiling.
1. Should I use a something like the Kidde SM120X Interconnect Accessories Smoke Relay Module and similar one for the CO2, or Qubino, or another model? Or maybe an Audio detector instead like the Ecolink one?
1. Do you need a box and blank cover plate on the ceiling to access the relays, or can you put behind the detector or just access only in the attic? Thinking about aesthetics.
1. Should I get an external power supply (e.g., Altronix) with battery backup, or is there a way to meet my requirements using the detector's battery backup (i.e., 9v or integrated lithium)?
1. Any thoughts on how many detectors I should plan for? Thinking 1 for each of the three bedrooms, 1 in the short hallway, 1 in the living room, 1 in the den, 1 in the kitchen, 2 in the FROG, 1 in laundry room, 1 in garage, and 1 in workshop?

Leviton 3-Way Smart Switch Help,"Trying to wire a 3-way switch with Leviton DZ15S-1BZ master switch and DD0SR-01Z coordinating switch.  About to give up thinking this may not be possible.

I have found the following configurations of the coordinating switch get these end results.

1. No light from either switch / clicking noise when toggling either switch shows that there is communication between the 2.

* White = neutral terminal screw marked WH
* Black = Traveler terminal screws marked YL/RD

2.  Master switch turns lights on/off.  Coordinating switch does nothing.

* White = Line/Load terminal screw marked BK
* Red = Traveler terminal screw marked RD

If I wire in really any other manner this this, the master switch does not turn on or off the lights.

Wemo smart outlet high data usage?,"I've got 3 Wemo Mini Smart Plugs that are clients of 2 different Ubiquiti Unifi APs.

What carpeting works best for a robo-vacuum?,"We're looking to recarpet our bedrooms &amp; living room. We're also picking up a couple robotic vacuums to keep with the basic upkeep (likely Roborock or Deebot).

Is there a certain carpet type that cleans up best? We're open to all carpet types that aren't truly hideous. Any pile, style, material, etc. Transitions would be from hardwood to carpet entering these rooms. 

Also, I don't think this is relevant, but we have a medium hair dog, a small child and a long haired wife that sheds worse than the others. 

Looking for advice on the best carpet type to avoid problems foremost (transition hang ups, pickup issues, docking issues) and then focused on whatever carpeting the bots would be best at cleaning.

If I buy the 1-gang light switch ... I now have 2 buttons. How many moods and functions can I apply to these 2 buttons? Could button 1 be on/off, and button 2 be something different such as 'cycle moods' or 'cycle brightness levels'? Obviously this would require configuration with the link plus and app.

Can additional ceiling lighting be added - without running new wiring to the switch? Can it be wired to existing ceiling lighting for power but still be independently controlled - e.g. with a Lightwave RF relay?",r/homeautomation,2020-11-16 16:09:50,Settings moods with Lightwave RF,"I'm researching a self-installed Lightwave RF smart setup and really grateful for answers to these questions.

New build home - Smart home NVR help,"So I have been doing my research on smart home stuff for a new build I am doing and am stuck on the camera part. I have experience with IP POE installs with an NVR. 

I am looking for 5 cameras outside and 3 cameras in the kids room. In our current house we currently use Wyze cams and they are easy for the purpose of watching the kids as a baby monitor. 

All I really want to accomplish with this new house is the ability to have POE hardwired outdoor cameras going to an NVR and 3 WiFi indoor cameras that could be separate from the NVR system for the kids rooms. The big thing I would like to do is have Alexa support where I can tell Alexa to “view outdoor cameras” and the NVR hdmi showing all cameras will load on my main TV in the living room. Or say view kids rooms and have the 3 kids room show on the TV.

Are smart switches inherently safer than smart relays or does safety completely depend on the design of each individual product?,"I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/jttuhc/are_smart_relays_a_safe_and_good_option_to_make/) recently to find out if relays are a safe way to make dumb lights smart.

&amp;#x200B;

Before picking one over the other, I'm wondering if there is something in the design of the smart switch that makes it safer than a smart relay (assuming that both of them have **only** the CE marking and that the wiring is performed correctly)? E.g. maybe the smart switch needs less space and isn't crammed so heat can be dissipated better.

&amp;#x200B;

If one is not safer than the other, and both of them have only the CE marking, is it unwise to buy either of them?

Device status response time on Homeseer.,"Last year I jumped ship and moved from SmartThings to HS3. When setting up automations I had one that would trigger my bathroom fan if the lights were turned on. The automation failed because it took minutes for HS3 to detect the change in status on the light.

How to control the lights above bathroom mirror with rules?,"I have 5 lights above bathroom mirror. They are so bright and always wanted to replace them with low intensity and smart bulbs. I am thinking on achieving below,can some give an idea?

when I enter ( with motion sensor) I will turn on 3 lights, and there should be some trigger, based on which which next two lights should turn on. What are some ideas I can think of?

What I am thinking and my reasons

1. using a NFC trigger -- This will be a challenge when there are guests. I can explain them to use a trigger to turn on all, but adding NFC is a challenge
2. adding a temp switch -- I wanna use this as a last option. 
3. Make switches smart - currently I live in a rented place, so this is not an option.

Any SmartPlugs w/ esp8266/32 custom firmware support and Power Consumption?,"Looking around to see if there are any cheap smart plugs out there based on the ESP8266 or ESP32 with power consumption that can be flashed with custom firmware.

Will a new switch help me?,"I have installed10+ Leviton Leviton DZ15S-1BZ around my home and had luck with the neutral wire being there and able to be used.

I came upon a 3-way switch scenario where it looks like my electrical is set up in a 'Line-Switch-Load-Switch' manner instead of the 'Line-Switch-Load-Switch' manner or something comparable.

What I've run in to is that the Coordinating Switch (Leviton DD0SR-01Z) only has one wire running into this eletrical box.

I've discovered that I can get the lights to turn on from both switches but I cannot get them to turn off.

I did this by hooking up the traveler wires and the common wire to the common terminal (instead of the ""neutral"" that the instructions state).  This is different from my other 3-way switches where the Coordinating Switch only requires that neutral connection and one traveler wire.

I believe my issue with only getting lights to turn on, but not off is due to the wiring of the Coordinating Switch.  Any thoughts on what can be done to get this to work?

So many choices out there...where to begin?,"We bought our house in March and I knew not a single thing about home automation and had no smart devices. I've read over the sticky and this sub is amazing. Thank you in advance! We now have:

2x Nest Learning Thermostats ($50 each from PSEG I couldn't pass up)

7x Smart plugs from Amazon and Treatlife (Office workstations, UV Filters for HVAC, plug in lamps etc...)

5x Echo Dots

1x Envisalink EVL4 (alarm system) - no smart/touchscreen keypad just 3x 6160's and 1x 6160RF and a new Vista 20-P panel

3x Smart light bulbs from LIFX and Sengled (these are used for our nightstands and a hallway light so we don't trip)

4x Blink Outdoor Cameras and 2x Indoor - I hate the outside ones and they are going back as soon as I have replacements.

Wants:

\- Motion sensor that turns on all my existing outside lights (4 different lights on one switch), I can hardwire but don't know if this exists. Essentially I want motion outside to turn an inside switch on AND still be able to still use the switch from inside. My driveway is a culdesac so 2 motion sensors would be ideal depending on which way someone drives in.  I don't want these running all day, just when we want it to or when there is motion. I tried a few smart bulbs, but you still have to remember to tell Alexa to turn on the lights as you drive up. This part of the house is old and has no neutral in the junction box. Ideally, this would also send me an alert somehow but not important.

\- I would also like to automate my indoor lights. I have 50ish high-hat/can lights throughout the house. The first thing I did when I moved in replaced each one with LED's so I don't want to replace the bulbs as I already dropped a few hundred $. I would be willing to replace the hardwired switches but want to pick a brand that works with my other stuff. 

\- Some kind of way to disarm the Envisalink besides using our phones. I always forget until we are already parked in the detached garage. I could add a keyfob but this seems like dated technology. I would also be willing to swap the Envisalink with something else. I rather enjoy tinkering with the alarm system.

\- NVR system with 6-8 cameras (I'm looking at Reolink but can be sold on others). I just ran a bunch of new outlets to a closet with my modem/router and will be dedicated to all these electronics. I can also put a hub or 2 in there if needed. I have a router satellite in my detached garage which I will use for POE for the cameras. The cameras attached to the house will run from closet NVR to attic down the eaves. A few hours worth of work but only have to do it once!

\- This is not as important, but a sensor that would turn on a plug or outlet when the HVAC fan goes on. I don't like the UV lights running 24/7 as the bulbs are expensive. I've seen someone set up a piece of paper that flaps inside the ductwork with a smartthings motion sensor that then triggers a plug/strip. I would go down this route if you think I could get use out of the smartthings hub for other wants.

"New Dishwasher, can this be automated?","New dishwasher is coming soon, so I still have access to the outlet behind it. I know it’s a quiet dishwasher but is there some way I could automate when the dishwasher runs?

For example, set it so that it runs at 2AM on Sunday, Wednesday, Friday or whatever...?

I’m not sure that adding a smart outlet will help, it can turn the power on at the desired time, but I don’t think it will make the dishwasher run...

Any thoughts?

I have Hubitat, Zigbee and Zwave. Asking here since I don’t think Hubitat will be my limitation.

Can I connect in parallel those two strips to such controller?

Shall I gift a robot vacuum for my parents?,"Hey,

Any concerns about Aqara/Xiaomi devices in the US?,"I'm looking for a replacement to the Smartthings Button Remote since those seem to be gone, and really like the options from Aqara (especially [this](https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-MFKZQ01LM-Cube-Control-Panel/dp/B07S9G5MR6) sweet cube controller) **but** I don't like that they have their own independent app, and it seems like all my devices would have to be added there too, just like Smartthings.

I'm mostly concerned because I don't know enough about smart home cybersecurity, especially when it relates to Chinese companies. My understanding is that they have a less-than-stellar track record as far as data collection is concerned, but like I said, I'm far from an expert on that kind of thing.

Anyone done thorough research into Xiaomi/Aqara enough to know if they're a safe/secure choice? If they're not, are there relatively straightforward steps I can take to mitigate any risks?

"Installed Amcrest Video Doorbell, fried internal doorbell","I have an Amcrest Video Doorbell that I tried to hookup today. I learned that a 16V 30VA transformer was required, so I turned off the breaker for that area, replaced the current 16V 10VA transformer with the new one, and the original doorbell still worked fine. I then switched the breaker back off, and then installed the (what I assume is) ground loop supplied by Amcrest and hooked it up to the same two terminals on the original doorbell itself, as instructed. I then proceeded to hook up the Amcrest Video Doorbell to the outdoor doorbell wiring, and then turned the breaker back on. I heard a humming get louder and louder, and an unfortunate, electrical smell. I turned off the breaker, and reverted back to my original setup excluding the new transformer.

Thanks!",Installed Amcrest Video Doorbell fried internal doorbell I have an Amcrest Video Doorbell that I tried to hookup today I learned that a 16V 30VA transformer was required so I turned off the breaker for that area replaced the current 16V 10VA transformer with the new one and the original doorbell still worked fine I then switched the breaker back off and then installed the what I assume is ground loop supplied by Amcrest and hooked it up to the same two terminals on the original doorbell itself as instructed I then proceeded to hook up the Amcrest Video Doorbell to the outdoor doorbell wiring and then turned the breaker back on I heard a humming get louder and louder and an unfortunate electrical smell I turned off the breaker and reverted back to my original setup excluding the new transformer The doorbell only now makes a low hum noise each time I push the doorbell ringer I believe that somehow it was fried What did I do wrong and are there any suggestions as to how I can remedy this Thanks

Voice summoning an elevator (lift)?,"I have a private elevator in my apartment that takes a while to arrive - I'd like to be able to summon it by voice using the Google Assistant, and for bonus points, announce when it has arrived.

Are smart relays a safe and good option to make dumb lights smart?,"I'm based in Europe and there are almost no smart switches available here. I've found a few, but I'm not sure how reliable / trustworthy they are.

Best wifi mesh system for my situation?,"Hello Everyone!
Hope everyone is well and safe.
Basically my situation is that I'm looking for a mesh system best tailored for my situation.

My current situation consists of:
- From the UK
- With Virgin Media M200 (200mbps) 
- house is around 2800 sq ft
- house is made of brick
- house is around 3 floors
- my room is on the second floor
- virgin media modem is placed on the second floor in other room
- budget £200 tops
- must have ethernet connection on mesh points.

So I'm getting this mesh system for gaming (ps5). I'm currently with Virgin media m200mbps, I only get such speeds when standing right next to the modem but once I'm in my room I only get around 50mbps. So basically I wanted to get the most out the Internet package I'm on. The most important room is my room which is where I'm going to put one mesh point and use an ethernet cable to connect my PS5 to that mesh point. My goal is to get the full 200mbps provided by my modem to the PS5.

Some issues tho, I was told that the mesh poinys will be half the speed of the Internet provided by the modem, is this true? (Hopefully not)
I cannot run a ethernet cable from my ps5 to the modem as they are in different rooms on the same floor, so thats not an option.

Thank you for taking the time to read my situation.
Bare in mind I'm completely new to home WiFi stuff as I have only ever used the WiFi modem provided by the broadband

Quick edit: should I just get a third party router like from netgear, comnect that to the modem and connect my devices alone to the router and the rest to the modem.

Any advice would be appreciated!

Smart plug to control battery percentage... beneficial or not?,"So I have a robot vacuum and noticed it being on charge with the battery at 100% most of the time. 

So to save the battery health in the long term, I installed a smart plug which turns on and off to allow the battery to stay at about 80%. It turns off at night etc.

Best teachable RF bridge/hub to use with Apple Home/homebridge?,"I have 14 Internorm window blinds that are controlled by an iOS app that talks to a Mediola AIO gateway/hub device. The iOS app is pretty rubbish and the devices are neither HomeKit nor Alexa-compatible. I've been developing a homebridge plugin so that I can control them from the Apple Home app. It works, but after a while the Mediola device stops working and the blinds no longer respond to either the iOS app or the Home app, although they do still work with their own remotes. My conclusion is that the Mediola device can't cope with the HomeKit/homebridge polling.

I believe the blinds are controlled via RF, and I would like to find an alternative hub/bridge/gateway/whatever you want to call it to use instead of the Mediola. I want one that:

* can be taught the RF commands to open &amp; close each blind, learning from the existing remotes
* will work with Apple Home, so be either directly HomeKit-compatible or via a homebridge plugin, or have an API available so that I can write my own homebridge plugin
* doesn't need Internet access in order to work (i.e. no subscription required, all traffic on LAN only etc).

How to use SmartThings cast-web-api to trigger custom sounds/audio on Google Home speakers,"This works by installing cast-web api, WAMP server, and using a simple Webcore piston.

Basically, cast-web api uses the ""broadcast"" feature of Google speaker devices to play text-to-speech whenever a SmartThings automation is triggered. For example, if a button gets pushed, you could have a Google Mini say ""Good morning!""

I decided to take it a step further. I downloaded some free audio files, stored them in a folder on my computer, hosted them locally using WAMPserver, and used Cast-web api to play those .mp3 files on my Google Home speakers. You could record your own voice or use free .mp3 clips you find online.

This worked really well for Halloween but there's definitely a lot of other use cases. For example, if someone presses my Ring Doorbell, then it'll play creepy witch laughing sounds on a Google Mini (which I've set on my porch). There's tons of other ways you could make use of this setup: 

 • If window opens after 11pm, record custom audio to ""shout"" at intruder.

 • If motion detected, then play ""alarm"" sound

 • If leak is detected, then verbally announce via Google Home speakers.

I'm actually quite surprised that I haven't found a guide online to do this, so I decided to create one for you guys: https://smarthomepursuits.com/play-custom-audio-through-google-home-speakers-using-smartthings-automations/

"Outdoor motion sensing, camera &amp; Xaomi Aqara tie-in","Hi everyone. I was hoping to get some recommendations on how best to get some new functionality into my current ecosystem. I'd like to avoid having too many different hubs and apps and systems going on.

I have a couple of TP-Link smart outlet switches that use a Kasa app, and a couple from Zoozee that use a Smart Life app. In general, I control these with Google Nest minis / Google Home app. I have 4 Xiaomi Aqara temp/humidity sensors, but I don't like the Xiaomi hub or interface. 

Here's the functionality I'd like to add:

1. I'd like to be able to send alerts based on temp or humidity and capture history to my NAS drive. I haven't seen how to do that with the Xiaomi hub. Would setting this up with Smartthings give the functionality I want? Other suggestions?
2. I have outdoor light fixtures (2 sets of 2 fixtures - one on 1 switch, one is 3-way). Ideally I'd like these on a timer with motion sensing. ie. come on at dusk and stay on until 9pm, then only when motion is sensed. Possibly add geofencing instead of motion sensing. What's a robust motion sensor that works outside?

My current ideas for #2 are:

* Ikea Tradfri bulbs &amp; motion sensor. I don't know how well the motion sensor would work outside.
* These [motion-sensing light bulbs](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/feit-electric-intellibulb-motion-activated-60-watt-equivalent-a19-90-cri-led-light-bulb-soft-white-2700k-/1001340066) \- not a smart solution, but would get me most of the way.
* [TP-Link lightswitch](https://www.amazon.ca/TP-Link-Required-Requires-Assistant-HS200/dp/B01EZV35QU/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&amp;keywords=kasa+light+bulb&amp;qid=1605377298&amp;s=hi&amp;sr=1-8) \- would just be on a schedule I guess. I was also thinking about adding a camera - not sure if the Kasa camera motion detection can trigger the light switches. I'd also have to make sure I have a neutral wire in the boxes.

I'd appreciate any suggestions, cautions or guidance.

I have a couple of TP-Link smart outlet switches that use a Kasa app, and a couple from Zoozee that use a Smart Life app. In general, I control these with Google Nest minis / Google Home app. I have 4 Xiaomi Aqara temp/humidity sensors, but I don't like the Xiaomi hub or interface.   Here's the functionality I'd like to add:  1. I'd like to be able to send alerts based on temp or humidity and capture history to my NAS drive. I haven't seen how to do that with the Xiaomi hub. Would setting this up with Smartthings give the functionality I want? Other suggestions? 2. I have outdoor light fixtures (2 sets of 2 fixtures - one on 1 switch, one is 3-way). Ideally I'd like these on a timer with motion sensing. ie. come on at dusk and stay on until 9pm, then only when motion is sensed. Possibly add geofencing instead of motion sensing. What's a robust motion sensor that works outside?  My current ideas for #2 are:  * Ikea Tradfri bulbs & motion sensor. I don't know how well the motion sensor would work outside. * These [motion-sensing light bulbs]  \- not a smart solution, but would get me most of the way. * [TP-Link lightswitch]  \- would just be on a schedule I guess. I was also thinking about adding a camera - not sure if the Kasa camera motion detection can trigger the light switches. I'd also have to make sure I have a neutral wire in the boxes.  I'd appreciate any suggestions, cautions or guidance.

Is this crazy. NOT prewiring for shades during construction and just using batteries?,"So I am doing my own low voltage wiring in our house that is almost finished up framing.  I am going with Lutron Ra2 select and I have 13 windows that will 100% have automated shades and then a handful more that might some day (probably 50/50 chance).  Was planning on the Lutron Sivoia QS wireless.

My initial plan was to pre-wire for power with a standard 18/2 wire and use the clear connect for control.  However, at the window locations that I am unsure if we ever will put in shades I have no idea how I would pre-wire for power and be able to access it later without it hanging down through (obviously unsightly).

So now I am thinking since I am uncertain that I should just not pre-wire anything and then go with batteries. None of the window locations will be hard to access the batteries (i.e. No huge windows) and if they last 3 years that doesn't sound like too much trouble.

Microchip pet feeder that has a timer?,"A little bit of a different post than the others I’ve seen on here but I think it still applies. I have a SureFlap pet feeder that only opens when it detects the microchip of the intended pet. It works great for my younger kitten who needs food available 24/7 right now, especially since I work long overnight shifts and my older cat will eat any food left out in the open. On the other hand, my older cat has a simple automatic feeder that empties into a bowl set into strict portions 4x a day. This has worked well for years before new kitten.

Cue current problem: kitten has access to his food as described, but it ALSO eating all of the older cats food when the timer goes off. When I’m home I shoo him away but as mentioned, I’m gone for 13-15 hours a day at least 3-4 days a week so I can’t always be there. What I need is a microchip feeder (tags will not work, she can’t wear a collar due to dermatitis) that also has a timer setting to limit and space out here meals. Does this exist? I’ve googled and found options *almost* meeting the criteria but not quite....",r/homeautomation,2020-11-14 06:43:21,Microchip pet feeder that has a timer?,"A little bit of a different post than the others I’ve seen on here but I think it still applies.

Thermostat for AirBNB (Florida) that will automatically set temp when guests not around?,"Hi all. Love this thread (have a c4 system at home). We've got a rental condo in Florida that is mostly airbnb'd. Would love to put in an 'automated' thermostat that will (a) let me set the min/max temp that a guest can set the temp to, (b) automatically sets the temp to X deg when no motion has been sensed for Y hours ... eg. set the temp to 80 deg F after 24 hours of no motion.

What we DON'T want is to have to login and set/reset temps remotely. We want something we can set and forget. Also, we don't have any automation controllers in the condo so the thermostat needs to be self-contained/self-automating.

What thermostats or solutions would you recommend? Anybody have experience doing this in a rental airbnb that can share experience?
