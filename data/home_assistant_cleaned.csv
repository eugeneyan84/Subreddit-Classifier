Ditching Alexa,"I’m really getting tired of the Alexa integration always asking me to sign in again. I never use Alexa for voice or to control devices anymore. I figured I can setup almond or something on its place.

My main questions are these two:

1) what is the experience like when using Almond (or another local option)?

2) what speakers would be recommended? Just cheap, small speakers that I may occasionally play synchronized audio throughout the home?

I’m pretty crafty with node red and use it for all of my automations.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-28 04:19:07,Ditching Alexa,"I’m really getting tired of the Alexa integration always asking me to sign in again.

Peanut Plug Firmware Upgrade Tutorial -ZHA,"We finally have a way to upgrade Peanut Plugs with the firmware that fixes the power reporting w/out having to buy an almond router using ZHA   


I found the tutorial on github to be super confusing, but I figured it out so here's the workflow that worked for me.   


First steps: make folder called zigpy\_ota under the config directory. The file path should be:  /config/zigpy\_ota   


Grab the firmware from the last post in the github thread and throw it in that directory.   
[https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/419#issuecomment-667109912](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/issues/419#issuecomment-667109912)  


Update your config .yaml to include ota: and the directory. Mine looks like this (Redditt does weird things to the spacing/indentation, please adjust accordingly) :   


zha:  
  zigpy\_config:  
network:  
channel: 15             # What channel the radio should try to use.  
channels: \[15, 20, 25\]  # Channel mask  
ota:  
otau\_directory: /config/zigpy\_ota  


Set logging details:  
logger:

  default: info

  logs:

homeassistant.core: warning  
homeassistant.components.zha: debug  
bellows.zigbee.application: info  
bellows.ezsp: info

zigpy\_xbee.zigbee.application: info  
zigpy\_xbee.api: info  
zigpy\_zigate: info  
zigpy\_znp: info  
zhaquirks: info  


  


Reboot HA  


Open up a terminal session and tail the log with this:  
 tail -f /config/home-assistant.log   | egrep OTA   


Next, go to the Plug in ZHA and get the IEEE Mac under device info, then go into Dev Tools and go to services. Use the ""zha.set\_zigbee\_cluster\_attribute"" service and this into the Service Data section and then press ""Call Service"".   


ieee: 'Peanut IEEE from Device Info'  
endpoint\_id: 1  
cluster\_id: 5  
attribute: 2  
cluster\_type: out  
value: 49502  


After a few seconds you should see log entries like this:

These will increment again and again until 100% You should do this with the plug close to HA or it will take a LOT longer. It takes about 5-10 minutes for each upgrade with it close by,

"Hey Home Assistant squad! With Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales in full swing, what protocols are your go-to to purchase in 2020?","2020 seems to be the world of WiFi or Zigbee - but I'm curious to hear from the community's perspective: what are your go-to protocols for security and user experience? 

Currently, my whole home mainly consists of WiFi devices (mostly Tuya). Once you're able to get familiar with home assistant, I've found that these types of devices are very easy to customize and automate within HA. That said, there are some problems I've found with Tuya devices in particular, namely no-brand = lower quality (but for the price, maybe still worth the replacements vs Zigbee devices in the long run), and also potentially less secure with so many devices talking directly to the Internet (currently looking into VLAN as a solution though).

For what it's worth, I've started creating custom ESP32 devices that utilize MQTT to go into an even more secure (100% localized) route. It truly looks like it's my favorite communication method to get into, although there aren't many (if any at all) consumer products that you can buy with MQTT off the shelf :)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-27 21:59:50,"Hey Home Assistant squad!

Two-Factor Issue/Missing App Options,"Haven’t messed with HA in a few months aside from an occasional update. Lost my phone, and it wasn’t backed up recently, so I can’t log in because HA is no longer showing up in the Authenticator app.

My wife still has access on her phone, and I tried to turn off two-factor. But I can’t see options like configuration, etc. I assume that’s because she’s not an admin?

At any rate, is there any way to fix this using her app, or am I SOL? 

I assume the next step is to access the configuration file on my server directly and edit the code to turn two-factor off?

I've just bought a load of IKEA tradfri stuff for the first time,"I have my home assistant set up to work with Zigbee and I've tested it by connecting 4 Philips hue bulbs although for some reason it won't pick up the traffic stuff which seems a little odd considering it is marketed as working with other Zigbee hubs whereas hue is known for being a pain in that respect, so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to why this may not be working or how to fix it?

just for clarification, I'm using ZHA to manage my Zigbee and the radio is the Texas Instruments based radios with Z-Stack any help would be much appreciated and I plan to post the results of anything that does not work in an edit after it's fixed so others can use it (too many times have I found posts about stuff like this and they don't post the solution it's really annoying)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-27 21:06:09,I've just bought a load of IKEA tradfri stuff for the first time,"I have my home assistant set up to work with Zigbee and I've tested it by connecting 4 Philips hue bulbs although for some reason it won't pick up the traffic stuff which seems a little odd considering it is marketed as working with other Zigbee hubs whereas hue is known for being a pain in that respect, so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to why this may not be working or how to fix it?  just for clarification, I'm using ZHA to manage my Zigbee and the radio is the Texas Instruments based radios with Z-Stack any help would be much appreciated and I plan to post the results of anything that does not work in an edit after it's fixed so others can use it (too many times have I found posts about stuff like this and they don't post the solution it's really annoying)",151,13,"I've just bought a load of IKEA tradfri stuff for the first time I have my home assistant set up to work with Zigbee and I've tested it by connecting 4 Philips hue bulbs although for some reason it won't pick up the traffic stuff which seems a little odd considering it is marketed as working with other Zigbee hubs whereas hue is known for being a pain in that respect, so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to why this may not be working or how to fix it?  just for clarification, I'm using ZHA to manage my Zigbee and the radio is the Texas Instruments based radios with Z-Stack any help would be much appreciated and I plan to post the results of anything that does not work in an edit after it's fixed so others can use it (too many times have I found posts about stuff like this and they don't post the solution it's really annoying)",I've just bought a load of IKEA tradfri stuff for the first time I have my home assistant set up to work with Zigbee and I've tested it by connecting 4 Philips hue bulbs although for some reason it won't pick up the traffic stuff which seems a little odd considering it is marketed as working with other Zigbee hubs whereas hue is known for being a pain in that respect so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas as to why this may not be working or how to fix it just for clarification I'm using ZHA to manage my Zigbee and the radio is the Texas Instruments based radios with Z-Stack any help would be much appreciated and I plan to post the results of anything that does not work in an edit after it's fixed so others can use it too many times have I found posts about stuff like this and they don't post the solution it's really annoying

With Cyber Monday coming up ... What is your idea of the ultimate Smart Home TV?,"Currently looking for a new TV and wondering which Smart TV setups are out there, are recommended, or integrate well with Home Assistant. Please share your experiences!

Help with MQTT Setup for Tasmota Sensor PMS 5003,"Greetings!

&amp;#x200B;

I have been able to connect PMS 5003 to Wemos D1 mini and obtain some reading. However, I do not use auto-discovery with my mqtt. Is there any way for me to set up my configuration.yaml in order to send information from D1 Mini to my mqtt broker and then to Home Assistant?

Using mqtt explorer I am able to capture the data that D1 mini is emitting, however, I don't know how to make sense of it to connect it with HA.

Automating Roku to launch specific content,"Is it possible to control the Roku remote to navigate to in-app menus and start specific content?

1. ""Hey Siri, start Morning TV"" - Turns the TV on -&gt; Launch NewsOn app -&gt; Go to Favorites tab -&gt; Starts specific news show
2. ""Hey Siri, start TV\_SHOW"" - Turns TV on -&gt; Launch Plex -&gt; Clicks Play on TV\_SHOW

Use an 'Entities' Card to change a lock code on a door - data to a service,"I am just learning home assistant.

I have installed on a RaspberryPi3B and have a [zwave.me](https://zwave.me) usb dongle.  The zwave integration is working well.

I have a kwikset 912 lock **that I can lock/unlock, and I can set the code(s) on it using the Developer Tools &gt; Services**.  I use the ""lock.set\_usercode"" service to set the code with data (example):

`node_id: 2`

`code_slot: 3`

`usercode: 7731`

I created a script to call this service, and I am having a problem getting data from the UI to this service.  If I leave the values hardcoded, the call to the service works:

`alias: set_lock_code_2`

`sequence:`

  `- service: lock.set_usercode`

`data_template:`

`node_id: '{{node_id_v}}'`

`code_slot: '{{code_slot_v | int}}'`

`usercode: '{{usercode_v}}'`

`mode: single`

`variables:`

  `node_id_v: 2`

  `code_slot_v: 3`

  `usercode_v: 7731`

But I am having trouble creating a 'card' for the entry of information and passing it to the service.

I set up an Entities card with fields (helpers) to enter the data.

`type: entities`

`show_header_toggle: false`

`entities:`

  `- entity: input_number.lock_code_slot`

  `- entity: input_number.lock_code`

  `- entity: script.set_lock_code_2`

`name: Set Door Code`

`title: Set Scottish Room Door Code`

However, when I replace the hard-coded values in the script with what I *\*think\** needs to be there, the script is no longer called.  I see no output in the logs.

`alias: set_lock_code_2`

`sequence:`

  `- service: lock.set_usercode`

`data_template:`

`node_id: '{{node_id_v}}'`

`code_slot: '{{code_slot_v | int}}'`

`usercode: '{{usercode_v}}'`

`mode: single`

`variables:`

  `node_id_v: 2`

  `code_slot_v: input_number.lock_code_slot`

  `usercode_v: input_number.lock_code`

I feel like I must be missing something pretty basic.

What can I choose b/w Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop vs Wyze vaccum keeping HA in mind.," Hello Experts,

This will be another BF deal request , thanks for your patience in reading it.

I  have pre ordered Wyze vaccum cleaner which costs $199 and I see a BF  deal for Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop in amazon, which is  coming for $350.

can someone help me choose the right to me?

1. currently  I live in an apartment, and we are looking for homes, so we will move  sometime later. I currently have Carter and wooden floor  lives in 2nd  floor.
2. If I but now, I really do not want to change at least for 5 yrs.
3. I  do see there is huge difference in price, but I wanna choose privacy  over price - I mean, I know both are Chinese brands(not really sure abt  wyze) but with what I know Xiaomi vaccum can be flashed to use locally  with MQTT so it will not contact the any cloud servers w.r.t Privacy. I was reading [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/giipq3/which_robot_vacuum_to_chose_for_full/fqg0zam?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I hope this is applicable for s5 pure as well. Can you guys please confirm?
4. Mopping is really not needed, but S6 has it as a bonus, I might use very less times.
5. any other points if I should consider?

Thank you for your time.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-27 20:58:16,What can I choose b/w Roborock S6 Pure Robot Vacuum and Mop vs Wyze vaccum keeping HA in mind.,"Hello Experts,  This will be another BF deal request , thanks for your patience in reading it.

Template Help,"I've been banging my head against the wall over this for a bit now. I'm trying to DIY a thermostat type deal for my newborn son's room using a small room heater on a Shelly controlled socket, and a temperature sensor that can be adjusted using a slider in Lovelace. I think a template is the way to go about it, but my Google-Fu isn't strong enough (I'm a solder jockey, not a programmer). I feel like if someone explained why this doesn't work and how to fix it once, it would click in my head (but I've overestimated myself before). I'm just trying to pull a boolean state to turn the heater off once it reaches temp.

    {{(state_attr(input_number.luke_s_room_temp_set) | float + 2) &gt;= (state_attr(sensor.lukes_h_and_t_si7021_temperature))}}

That returns "" UndefinedError: 'input\_number' is undefined "". That value should be defined by the value of the slider in Lovelace right?

If anyone has a more elegant way to go about it, I'm all ears too. Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: The hardware and MQTT is all in place with a humidifier as well to regulate both the temperature and humidity in the newborns room. Once I figure out a way to regulate the oxygen content and barometric pressure, I'll really be cooking lol.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-28 04:18:08,Template Help,"I've been banging my head against the wall over this for a bit now.

Netatmo integration suddenly reports lots of unavailable entities,"Over the course of the last week, I noticed that something has happened with my Netatmo integration.

Everything goes smooth and there are no errors logged. After successfully re-creating the Netatmo integration, all entity names are still different from the names I have used in my automations.   
**In addition; several unavailable entities are listed!**  
These are entities like *WiFi, Battery, Trends, Reachability* etc. of the climate (weather stations) that I have.  
These are not orphan entries from any previous integration, I know - because when I deleted the Netatmo Integration they all vanished, and then returned again as soon as the Netatmo integration was re-created.  I know for sure that I was able to read the battery level of the outdoor module earlier, because I have an alarm automation for it. Now, bttery level it is listed as an unavailable entity. But entities such as temperature, humidity, CO2 etc, are still readable.

(I have reported the same question to Netatmo, but they just point at the creator of the Partner App - as they call it)",Netatmo integration suddenly reports lots of unavailable entities Over the course of the last week I noticed that something has happened with my Netatmo integration I discovered this because several automations based on temperature readings stopped working Upon closer look it turned out that many not all of the Netatmo entity names had changed causing automations to fail Long story short After trying everything including several restarts and also re-install of HA I deleted the Netatmo integration restarted HA again and re-created the Netatmo integration from the UI Everything goes smooth and there are no errors logged After successfully re-creating the Netatmo integration all entity names are still different from the names I have used in my automations In addition several unavailable entities are listed These are entities like WiFi Battery Trends Reachability etc of the climate weather stations that I have These are not orphan entries from any previous integration I know  because when I deleted the Netatmo Integration they all vanished and then returned again as soon as the Netatmo integration was re-created I know for sure that I was able to read the battery level of the outdoor module earlier because I have an alarm automation for it Now bttery level it is listed as an unavailable entity But entities such as temperature humidity CO2 etc are still readable Do any of you have any idea why the Netatmo Integration suddenly reports a number of unavailable entities I have reported the same question to Netatmo but they just point at the creator of the Partner App  as they call it

Stupid question - how do I configure the action to send the email as an alert,"short version - I have Home Assistant up and running. Sensors connected and reporting temperature and water leaks. I can test with the developer tools my [notify.gmail](https://notify.gmail) and it all works fine. Last job is to connect them together (temp below 50 degrees send me an email and let me know current temperature that triggered the alarm). When I configure the automation it says that the UI does not support this (picture attached).

Stupid questions (you were warned)

Am I in the correct area to even configure this? Should I be using Node Red or hand editing a configuration file? If so - is there a guide or youtube video walking me through this? I would also accept just type in these three lines. :)

Also it would be smart if I could 'group' all the temperature sensors and leak sensors to generate alerts rather than configure them individually.

Hope everyone had a good thanksgiving. :)

Best option for white dimmable LED strip to control with z-wave?,"Goal: Dimmable LED strip for behind TV (will stay at that setting but I want to pick that dimming level, otherwise I would just use a z-wave plug) 

I see the Fibaro which I could pair with a simple white led strip to dim but I feel like that's overkill. Anyone find something with maybe a oldschool potentiometer on the strip itself? Set it once and incorporate into my family room scenes as on/off

If I do under counter lighting for my kitchen I would use the Fibaro or equivalent to set different light level output for different times or day and/or just scene controlled. I would like those lights on at night but nice and low, but obviously full blast when cooking.

Automation triggering by sequence,"So I'm having great fun with [Aqara Cube](https://www.aqara.com/us/cube.html), connected to my HA via [CC2531](https://www.itead.cc/cc2531-usb-dongle.html) and [zigbee2mqtt](https://github.com/danielwelch/hassio-zigbee2mqtt).

So, for example, my AC only turns off if I do the following sequence in a correct order (within a timeframe of 5 seconds): 

shake the cube

tap the cube

rotate the cube anticlockwise

Thermostat Card doesn't update,"I have my Google Nest Thermostat connected to HA and a thermostat card on my home screen. The card doesn’t seem to really ever update, though.

How do you build a sensor based on change-over-time?,"I've long since figured out simple 'if' statements and the usual mathematical operators... but I'd really like to have my home greet me on dark nights by turning on the porch light *before* I get into the driveway and without having to push any buttons.

I have a good GPS feed that updates my position every third of a mile, and I'd like to set up a sensor that can trigger my house lights under a circumstance like ""distance was over 1 mile in the last five minutes but is now under half a mile"".

I have SQL skills, so I plan to add a table in my MariaDB database that's constantly calculating the distance between my phone and my house, and I know how to turn a SQL query into a sensor... I'm just really fuzzy on how to even start on the final logic.

If there's no easy way to do it in HA script, I guess I can bake it all into SQL, but I'd like to know if there's an HA method before I start on that.

Can you trust Home Assistant to mange through power failures and interruptions?,"I do not have the ability to analyze Home Assistant's containerized architecture, but I am struck by:

    - How long it takes to boot up on the RP4 platform (in my case with 8GB memory)
    - How long it takes to shutdown
    - How many times I have had to restore from snapshot because 
        * Either I have turned the RP4 off too soon and hosed the micro SD or worse.

I realize that I need to take the appropriate precautions around this containerized platform, but a Windows machine survives very well the kind of insensitive to idiotic treatment that would be end-of-life for a Home Assistant system on Raspberry Pi.

I originally bought a Vera Edge unit for my Z-Wave but found the management of Z-Wave with HA better, especially with the Zooz ZST10 Z-Wave 2 USB plug-in device.  It is awesome.

Now I am worried about leaving a Raspberry Pi 4 for a weekend in case there is an interruption or other disturbance in the Force and am wondering, in general, about the fragility of this setup.

There was a pretty frank series of observations that met with too much ""true believer"" reaction for my comfort:

https://community.home-assistant.io/t/help-hassio-is-dead-after-power-outage/117938

Now, I am thinking I would be better off to use my home ESXi setup and a Home Assistant VM rather than a vulnerable Raspberry PI.  At the very least I can remote in and fix the Home Assistant VM!  But after spending the day trying to pass the Zoos USB stick through to the HA virtual machine, I think I have to go back to an external controller I can talk to via Ethernet.

If I could fix my Raspberry Pi remotely, without buying a $100k robot to re-image and switch out the Micro SDs, I would probably not not be worrying about changing platforms.  Right now, I do not see a 5 9s performance happening with a RP4.  (99.999% reliability has long been required by law for landline telephones, and I think it is normal to want something close in a home monitoring system.)

I do have a UPS, but I worry I am not up to repairing damage to an HA instance except by rip and replace and that means changing out the Micro SD.

My biggest question is can Smartthings or Vera provide me with the HA devices I need to build automations for being  away?

It Begins...,"Yup - another migration story. Feel free to skip.

I started with SmartThings as a Kickstarter backer. Over the years it's been mostly OK but things have slowly started to get less smooth. About once a year I have to repair/rejoin a bunch of of devices. Samsung took over and account migration, app changes and then the V1 hub stops getting updates. Realizing this is no longer a secure configuration for a network facing device I start looking at options.

The obvious easy path was the newest SmartThings hub but one thing that has always irked me is the latency inherent in the system. Lose your internet and everything fails to function. Adding to all the legacy irritation a couple of cloud based services move to a paid service model. ST hasn't done so but I can see it happening in the future.

So I start researching and hunting. As a longtime Linux/Open Source user I tend to gravitate to that model due to the community support. Home Assistant keeps showing up in my searches. Weeks of researching and weighing options I decide to pull the trigger. Fuck Samsung - let's go HA.

A RPi4 and a HUSBZB-1 later I'm ready to. A bunch of false starts, mostly tied to removing/resetting clients from ST. I managed to get a basic system running with about half the clients online and starting to get a feel for how it works. And then - nothing. Seems I missed the memo about Hassio being a little rough on SD cards. (Lesson One - snapshots, make and save them)

Sigh... OK, let's start again. New SD card until the M2 and USB enclosure show up. Most everything rejoins effortlessly and I'm able to set up the rest now that I have a handle on how to use HA to exclude zwave clients that ST still had a hold of. 

This time everything joins cleanly. Even my gen1 ST door and motion sensors come on line. I can set up a simple dashboard and basic automations. It's not the most elaborate system you'll see here but it works for me. It's lag free and under my control. Finally.

It's easy once you know what you're doing. Getting to that point took a couple of rounds of wrong turns but it's nothing like the warnings I heard.

Setting IKEA Tradfri LED1624G9 RGBW bulb to its hardware warm white LED,"I recently got an IKEA Tradfri RGB bulb to experiment with Zigbee lights, as the ESPhome-flashed Tuya stuff I currently use just don't get bright enough RGB-wise.

For the ESPhome bulbs, I have 2 sliders and a color picker available in the web UI, one slider for brightness and the other for ""White value"", so I can do stuff like slightly tint the white the bulb's warm while LED puts out. The IKEA LED however only has brightness and color, and I cannot seem to get the bulb's warm white LED to light up like it did when it was just paired, all I get is some slightly tinted cold white from what I presume to be red green and blue LEDs mixed.

How do I get the bulb's warm white LED to be controlled separate from the RGB? Or at least how can I easily set the bulb to its initial warm white? I gotta mention I use ZHA for my Zigbee stuff.

Solution for Multiple ZHA Integrations (Remote Home Assistant),"I've posted this as a reply elsewhere but though others might find it useful..

I've got 2 Sonoff Zigbee Bridges flashed with Tasmota. 1 for the house and 1 for the Garage (there's a significant distance between the 2).

I was pretty bummed that you can only have one ZHA connector in HA.. so my solution is this.

Multiple HA instances.

I run Proxmox, so it was easy to spin up a second HASSOS instance using Whiskerz007 script : https://github.com/whiskerz007/proxmox_hassio_lxc

Once that was up, i went about making it functional.. enabled the websocket API, creating a long lived access token, installing HACS and the Google Backup addon..

And then on my other (main) instance i installed Remote Home Assistant : https://github.com/lukas-hetzenecker/home-assistant-remote

Now I have 1 Sonoff Bridge connected to my main instance for my house devices, and 1 connected to the other instance for my Garage devices..

MY main interface is able to pull anything published in the garage one through to my main interface seamlessly.

You can even use nodered to talk to the devices via the main instance and it'll be redirected.

It's awesome.. I believe they've tried to get a PR put together to add it to HA natively but the code was messy and was denied.. but hey.. it works for me and means i don't have to decypher MQTT topics for my second controller.

Hope this helps some one!",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 23:42:10,Solution for Multiple ZHA Integrations (Remote Home Assistant),"I've posted this as a reply elsewhere but though others might find it useful..

Hue Play Lightbar as status indicator.,"Hello guys,

I’m here today with a special question. At our company we have multiple server rooms and we want to use the Play Lightbar at the top of the server racks indicating the status of the most things in it. For example: If some low priority service is offline the Lightbar is still green but flashing yellow maybe every 1 minute. Or if the whole system is shutdown (test racks) or some high priority service crashed the Lightbar is red. Would love to be able to use scenes for animations. 

My question: what we need for this? Is this possible with home assistant by using pings / port checker or http checkers? Is there maybe a better way to do this instead of using home assistant? 

Would love to hear some answers. Really searched the whole internet for something like this but it seems the most of people doesn’t want to have fancy stuff in their server rooms. We’re already have a touch display in every rack wich shows running services as cards wich indicate the status but since we don’t have glass doors you still have to open the door to see what is going on.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 15:46:40,Hue Play Lightbar as status indicator.,"Hello guys,  I’m here today with a special question.

Z-wave or Tasmota Wifi,"I  am running HASS and looking to add a large number of dimmers and  switches (moving my C4 to HASS).  My existing HASS devices are all WiFi  tasmotized or otherwise MQTT devices.   I have a very good WiFi system.  I like being independent of some company's cloud service.

How to achieve smooth dimming with IKEA Dimmer,"Would appreciate if someone can point me in the right direction. Not sure if I need NodRed or some custom .yaml file to achieve this.

* I got [this](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/tradfri-wireless-dimmer-white-10408598/) IKEA dimmer today.
* I paired it to my Conbee device via deconz using the Phoscon GUI.
* I can see the dimmer now in home assistant under ""devices"".
* I created a few automations (turn off/on, dim+/- on long press) using the GUI in the home assistant.

The issue is that the dim on long press only dims 10% at a time and I'd like continuous dimming. How can I achieve that?

I looked at [this](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/here-is-a-good-method-for-dimming-lights-in-deconz/138115) tutorial (and others) but I don't have any groups or lights in deconz.

Need ideas for enabling/disabling remote access to my home network when I leave/return home,"Despite my confidence in the security of my setup, I’d still like to further reduce my home network’s exposure to the internet by disabling remote access while I’m at home.

Is that something HomeAssistant can do? How?

I have port 443 on my FreshTomato router forwarded to that VM.

Which raspberry to choose,"Hello,
I'm currently thinking of trying home assistant. For the moments I only have two WiFi light bulb and I've got a temperature sensor which work on ZigBee. I'm also thinking on buying some more sensors for plants informations, led strips and also adding diy projects from esp8266.
I would use home assistant to have everything on the same app.
So to use home assistant I'm thinking of buying a raspberry and add a usb ZigBee dongle but I have difficulty to choose between the ones actually available.
I don't want to spend much and I'm not thinking of adding a lot of devices (10-15 max) and not cameras or others high demanding things. So I've searched on AliExpress and I have 4 choices : 
 - Raspberry zero Wh for 15€
 - Raspberry pi3 b+ for 34€
 - Raspberry pi4 2Go for 35€
 - Raspberry pi4 4Go for 52€
I think the pi3 is a bad idea because the pi4 2Go seems to have better performance for the same price but I'm not sure. So can some one help me to choose a device based on the numbers and types of devices I'm going to use please ?",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 17:19:19,Which raspberry to choose,"Hello, I'm currently thinking of trying home assistant.

ZHA: Is there a way to force state after reconnection / power failure?,"Hey everyone,

I'm using a flashed Sonoff ZB bridge with the ZHA component.

I have some sonoff zb switches and aqara lamps installed in light fixtures that are connected to a physical switch.

* Is there a way to set the ""power-on state"" of those zigbees, the default state they will have after the switch is flipped off and back on, or after a power failure?
* Is there a ZHA event i can use as a trigger when a device rejoins the network, so i can have HA do it?
* If this is not possible with ZHA, is it perhaps possible with Z2M? and can Z2M work with the sonoff zb bridge?

Thanks in advance!",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 08:17:27,ZHA: Is there a way to force state after reconnection / power failure?,"Hey everyone,  I'm using a flashed Sonoff ZB bridge with the ZHA component.

Lidl has released Zigbee 3.0 certified smart home gateway/hub and devices,"Lidl (the German international discount supermarket chain) has just released a Zigbee 3.0 certified smart home gateway/hub and many Zigbee 3.0 devices under their Silvercrest brand with low prices.

Samsung family Hub (smart fridge),"Hi folks, looking at Black Friday deals, and wondered if anyone had any good use cases of what is possible with the Samsung Family Hub on their smart fridges?

It works with smart things so wondered if anyone had tried:

1. Display lovelace (need casting?)
2. Can you cast any camera in the right format to the hub (if I add the camera from HA to smart things?) ie doorbell that isn’t a Samsung camera but in HA?
3. Does it respond to other inputs/direction - like google home (not bixby) like play music on the fridge? 

Trying to decide if it would be as useful as it could be with HA (I see there is an integration that pulls sensors etc)

Force Refresh Data From Eve Room?,"I’ve connected an Eve Room with an Eve Extend and gotten Home Assistant to be able to view the devices ([following these instructions](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/wth-homekit-integration/221003)), but sometimes they will go days without updating (and I know the numbers have changed because I can view them on the device itself).

Does anyone know how I can force Home Assistant to refresh the data for these devices?

Specifically, I would like to refresh air\_quality.eve\_room\_b109 about every 15 min.

Right now air\_quality.eve\_room\_b109 was updated 15 hours ago, but another number (sensor.eve\_room\_b109\_humidity) on the same device, updated two hours ago.

I’ve tried creating an automation to update the device, but it doesn’t seem to do anything:

VLAN setup for Home Assistant and other devices,"I am a newbie to VLAN and I am trying to figure out what hardware I need to achieve the outcome I want.

I have about 40 IP devices in my network and I have categorized them as

1- Devices that only require internet Access (cheap iot devices and camera that connect to cloud but can't be accessed locally)

2 - Devices that require only LAN access and NO internet access

3 - All other devices such as laptops and phones and home servers that require local and internet access

I am in the market for a mesh wifi system and am planning to buy a TP-Link system which supports one Public Wifi SSID and one guest Wifi SSID. I assume I can put devices in Category 1 above to the guest wifi and they will have only internet access and no access to my local devices. 

For the remaining 2, my understanding is that I need a VLAN to separate out the traffic. I also know that the TPLink doesn't support that. 

My questions are

1. Do I need a firewall/router type appliance such as a pfSense to acheive this (I guess yes). 
2. I understand I can create firewall rules that prevent traffic from going from one VLAN to another. But I have stuff like Airplay speaker that should be local only, but I should be able to play to them from my phone. I assume this can be done by allowing only certain ports and devices access between local vlan1 and local vlan2 while blocking out everything else 
3. This part is where I have a gap. How do I assign specific devices to specific VLANs ? Tutorials in youtube are Ubiquiti focussed and suggest having a separate SSID for each of those categories of devices. In my case, that is not possible as I can only have two SSIDs. How would pfSense put those devices in specific VLANs. Would I have to configure each device separately based on it's MAC address?

Any help or even a pointer to a youtube post would be much appreciated.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-26 08:22:12,VLAN setup for Home Assistant and other devices,"I am a newbie to VLAN and I am trying to figure out what hardware I need to achieve the outcome I want.

"Trane XR524 Z-Wave Thermostat ""Unavailable"" &amp; Temperature 0.0","Preemptive apology if this is a new ""*newbie*"" question - I literally started using HA **today** (*moving over from SmartThings*). (**TL;DR at bottom.**)

* zwave.thermostat
* climate.thermostat\_mode

I already attempted to unpair / pair again with the same result.

Best way to control Somfy RTS window covers?,"I've decided on Somfy for window coverings in my house, and I kept them all on the Somfy RTS protocol. FWIW they do seem to have some support for direct z-wave or zigbee integrations, but I don't think it's easy to do with every motor type, it's more expensive, and doesn't seem well supported. I want it to still be functional if my home network gets borked so their native RTS seemed like a safer bet.

So far a few of them have arrived and been installed and I couldn't be happier, they work well with the native somfy remotes, and the motors move very smoothly and are very quiet.

Anyway, from here it seems like there are multiple options to hook it into Home Assistant:

1. Somfy myLink device, it that looks like it has support in HA but it's a cloud service which I'd always rather avoid if there's a local option. I'll eventually have 8 total coverings I believe, and these myLink devices only support 5 channels each so I'd need to buy 2 of them.
2. There's a Z-Wave to Somfy RTS converter, it's more expensive but supports 16 channels so it'll work out about the same. It would be local, but not I can't really find much in the way of reviews of this so not sure if it'll be reliable.
3. There's a Somfy universal control that looks intriguing, but I can't tell if it'll be easy to integrate with HA or not. You send it serial rs232 messages over ethernet which I haven't worked with before. It also has pretty mixed reviews, some people claim the antenna is bad so it doesn't communicate reliably with the somfy motors, but then some people claim once you replace the antenna it's good.
4. Apparently more generic 433 Mhz radios can work like the RFXtrx433E, but it seems to be no longer produced it's out of stock everywhere I see it online.

Anyway, looking for input from anyone else with Somfy RTS motors. Are you using any of these options, and how does it work for you?",r/homeassistant,2020-11-25 22:28:35,Best way to control Somfy RTS window covers?,"I've decided on Somfy for window coverings in my house, and I kept them all on the Somfy RTS protocol.

Remove color temperature ability for Hue Lux light connected through Zigbee2MQTT?,"I have a Raspberry Pi 4 running Home Assistant, and I have connected a CC2531 Zigbee USB stick to it so I can create a network of Zigbee devices.

Migrating from CC2531 to CC2652 (ZZH) lost some devices,"I recently migrated from a cc2531 to a CC2652. Stable, fast, and I'm less worried about it breaking :D 

Running Zigbee2MQTT.

BUT, while my Livingwise  scene controller devices paired initially, they had no output from the buttons. After trying to re-pair one of them, it won't even appear in the logs as trying to pair. 

My LVS-ZB500D devices (similar) won't pair now either (fresh from the box) 

Before I go too deep into any rabbit holes here, are there incompatibilities with devices connecting to a newer 3.x.0 firmware on my coordinator? I would hope that Zigbee 3 is backwards compatible.

A Wake Up Lights - sharing setting,"I have configured a *Wake Up Lights* that may be useful to someone.

**Faetures**

* turns on defined lights at specific time - via Lovelace
* only when a specific person is at home - based on specific *device tracker*
* all days or working days only - via Lovelace
* can be conditioned by the sun angle for dark, gloomy etc. - via Lovelace
* set a timer to turn lights off after x minutes - via Lovelace
* this automation can be deactivated - via Lovelace

*Note: Pavel is a name of person*

Continuing with my humble home-made security system: alarm siren speaker now,"Hi again. I'm about to make an order on Amazon but the last step, for now (this hobby never ends), is a battery-powered alarm siren speaker. It'll be hidden somewhere. It needs to be loud. In case I buy a UPS in the near future, so that both the router and the Raspberry Pi + ConBee II will continue to work in case a burglar turns off the power of the apartment or something, even if there's no power in the apartment the loud siren will sound as soon as a burglar enters.

Is it possible to create a template(?) sensor with attributes defined by templates?,"Recently they changed the recycling system in my area so that instead of just two bins, we now have five. From before I had two `rest` sensors that utilized the same API endpoint and extracted their states from the response JSON. For just two sensors, that was fine.

Now that I'll need five sensors, I'd very much prefer to just send one API request and extract all five values from the same JSON response. Optionally, I could have multiple sensors and maybe use an automation or a script to set their values. I guess that route would make it easier to display the dates in separate cards?

Any ideas? I should mention that I haven't touhced Pyscript or AppDaemon so far, but if someone could give me some pointers I'd certainly give it a shot.

Would this bluetooth Eufy Smart Door lock be a huge paint to integrate with HA?,"The lock in question is the [Eufy Smart Lock](https://imgur.com/a/uBKAI7r) with fingerprint sensor.

The reason I ask is because this lock is ""smart"" in that it ONLY works with Bluetooth from their app.

Originally, I thought this would not be too tough to integrate, I could use a Bluetooth to MQTT gateway and integrate it like that. There are many examples of this from cheap sensors.

But then I thought, it may be a lot harder than those other examples due the most likely increased security of the lock itself. I would assume they put some sort of extra layer of security to prevent someone from sniffing the bluetooth and sending commands to the lock.

Repurposing old devices with HA,"Hi everyone, I'm very new to HA but I've got it all setup thanks to some handy walkthroughs on YouTube. Thus far I've only got some very basic things setup like my ecobee, Google Devices/Spotify, and external access from both my SO and I's phones via DuckDNS. 

I'm not really sure what else to do and quite frankly the options are overwhelming... I'm thinking of potentially making some of my plugs and light switches ""smart"" as well as exploring some camera setups this Black Friday.

"Okay, looking for cameras to pick up wildlife...","Hi!

So I live in a rural area, and we have tons of wildlife around our property. Foxes, bears, cougars, bobcats, etc. and I'd LOVE to capture them on video (for funsies). 

I'm having a hard time nailing down a plan for cameras, because obviously I'd like it to double as a security cam setup, and also link to HA, but I honestly have nowhere to start. 

I was eyeballing the blink cameras on-sale now, but they say they only really have a 20 foot activation range, and that might not be far enough at nighttime. 

Anyway, thoughts? I'm willing to spend a little money, or build out a rPI system to manage the video storage, but I really have no idea where to even start.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-25 19:27:23,"Okay, looking for cameras to pick up wildlife...","Hi!

I'm having a hard time nailing down a plan for cameras, because obviously I'd like it to double as a security cam setup, and also link to HA, but I honestly have nowhere to start.   I was eyeballing the blink cameras on-sale now, but they say they only really have a 20 foot activation range, and that might not be far enough at nighttime.   Anyway, thoughts?

AI for filtering out false positives in surveillance video captures," While this is not directly related to HA, I know that many of you are using cameras with your HA set up.  If anyone knows of a better place to ask this question, please do direct me.

I'm running motionEye as my NVR for my home surveillance system. This software works pretty great for motion detection but at night it gets a lot of false positives due to bugs/spiderwebs/etc in my video captures. While hard drive space is cheap, it does add up and makes going through these captures fairly tedious and time consuming.

I know that solutions do exist (Doods/Deep Stacks) that are able to identify cars/people/animals in photos. The problem with this is that parked cars also trigger a positive detection. Truth be told, I have been running an AI set up with Blue Iris for a while now and while it does work, I end up having to mask out areas for parked cars and when these cars move or others show up, it defeats the purpose.  I was running BI in a Docker container under Linux and while that also works, it does take up a lot more resources and is limiting me on adding additional cameras.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if anyone can tell me if there is something like Doods/Deep Stacks that is able to detect moving cars/people/animals in a capture? If so, I could script something that would process the recordings to see if it had something I was interested in and keep it or delete it otherwise.  I do not need this done in real time.  The ability to eliminate false positives from recordings would greatly reduce the amount of space needed for storing these clips and would allow for me to keep more of the clips that contain the objects I'm looking for.

Any help in this is most appreciated. All the best to you!",r/homeassistant,2020-11-25 15:38:24,AI for filtering out false positives in surveillance video captures,"While this is not directly related to HA, I know that many of you are using cameras with your HA set up.

Communicating HVAC System,"Next spring, I plan to replace my HVAC system: Furnace and AC. I have two zones which are controlled by ecobee3 thermostats. I’ve been generally happy with these thermostats, and I was hoping to keep using them with new system. However, I learned that the most efficient and green systems are now all controlled by proprietary communicating thermostats. For example: regular thermostat cannot control modulating furnace gas valve, and only is able to do two stages. The same for AC: no variable speed compressor control, only up-to two stages.

I found the following incompatible HVAC systems from various manufacturers:

Unifi Integration stopped working,"Hello, This one has stumped me for a few days. I had the Unifi integration working great for a few months using it for presence detection. I noticed earlier this week it stopped updating statuses, and all the entities showed in error. I rebooted, removed, and re-added the integration several times. I've confirmed the controller is functioning. The controller recognizes the login from HA on it's end, but shows no devices or entities.  I turned on logging and believe the relevant bit to the issue is below, I'm just struggling to decipher it. Any help would be appreciated. 

Edit: FIXED! Unifi controller was in need of an update.

Help with MQTT integration,"Absolute HA noob here, I'd appreciate some help with the following:  


I have a bunch of esp32s doing some control and  publishing different sensor data via mqtt to a raspberry pi running HA with mosquitto. They are added via the config file, for example:

switch:  
 - platform: mqtt  
   name: ""Extractor fan (building)""  
   command\_topic: ""building/fan""  
   state\_topic: ""building/fan/state""  
   availability\_topic: ""building-AG1/available""  
   payload\_on: ""on""  
   payload\_off: ""off"" 
   payload\_available: ""online""  
   payload\_not\_available: ""offline""

My issue is the following, if a node fails it should become unavailable in HA, however it will stay available until i restart HA (for weeks). this is obviously due to the fact once it dies it can't publish that it is offline to the availability topic. Is there a way to set a timeout or something for mqtt devices so they are marked unavailable if they don't publish to the avail. topic regularly? Or any other workaround? (or i am definitely just plain dumb and just missing a setting).

Questions about Alexa integration and network requirements.,"Looking to clear up the network requirements for Amazon Alexa/Google Assistant integration for voice control of devices such as switches and the like.

Based on the HA documentation it appears that I can do this without a subscription if I open up port 443 my router to fwd to the HA.  If I am already using port 443 for another purpose (like a secure web server using standard ports), then I would not be able to set this up.  Is that correct?

The Home Assistant Cloud is the alternative.  This is a subscription based service that would NOT require me to open any specific inbound ports as the communication channel is established by outbound connectivity to the HA Cloud API.

What i'm aiming at is that when i enter my house the display lights up so i can enter my code. Is there an windows based client for home assistant that can achieve this?

Recreating my Snapshot,"My SD card failed. HASS wouldn’t start. I yanked the card. Put it in my PC and was able to copy the files off. Got a new SD card. I have now have a new clean install...but can’t find a snapshot to reload. I do have the files I salvaged.

I tried copying the files to the new SD card, but it didn’t seem to load the original image.

Zwave capabilities when using Smartthings integration,"Hi all,

I'm just getting started with HA, and I'm currently using the Smartthings integration to bring my  Zigbee and Z-wave devices into HA. I'm planning to eventually buy a dongle and move over completely from ST, but I'm hoping to get some experience and familiarity first, because I've installed and abandoned HA about 5 times due to the learning curve.

I'm curious how much control I have over my Zwave devices with it integrated this way, specifically if I can put lock user management into effect for my Schlage BE469 lock, and scene control for my Zooz Zen27 switches.

I've done some googling on scene control for the switches, and what I've found indicates I need to edit my zwcfg file, which doesn't exist since the switches are integrated through smartthings rather than paired to a dongle.

I haven't yet looked into the lock user management end..

Anyone have any feedback as to what's available and what's limited by integrating Smartthings?

Giving up on Amcrest Doorbell - thinking DIY,"I am giving up on the Amcrest doorbell for now and returning it. Since I have a covered front porch, the deep shadow on faces at my door unfortunately makes it unusable. As I said in another post, it was fine when I placed my hand over the sensor to force the brightness to shift, but there is no way to do that manually. Additionally, if you disable motion detection notifications in the Amcrest app, it disables the doorbell press notifications. So it is all or nothing.I also understand that they restricted their API due to Duhua restricting theirs (maybe that's a rumor) - I have concerns about further development in HA. I wanted to ask about this on the Amcrest sub, but that sub is restricted and looks dead.

I have two Wyze v3 coming which I hope to use as a video feed for my door due to a better sensor and aperture, but they are still working on firmware for RTSP ([https://wyzelabs.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051619871-Does-the-v3-support-RTSP-](https://wyzelabs.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051619871-Does-the-v3-support-RTSP-))

&amp;#x200B;

What I eventually want:

1. Someone approaches my door. I get a notification and Facebox/Doodz sees if it recognizes them. This is separate from #2
2. Person pushes the doorbell button. If I am home, Alexa TTS that someone rang the bell. I get a notification on my Android phone that someone is there and would I like to answer or ignore them. If I answer, it opens a 2-way audio/1-way video call  (video both ways would be great down the road - like a teleconference call). If I ignore them, TTS asks them to leave a message and then starts a recording from the camera to be reviewed later. It records for 30 secs or so, then TTS makes a beep sound. Like an answering machine.

&amp;#x200B;

My current thoughts with equipment at hand:

1. Aqara switch mounted below the Wyze v3
2. Push switch - notification goes to our phones that someone pressed the doorbell. We open the Wyze app and use that for 2-way communication

This would be a $25-$35 solution (depending on where you get the switch. Cams were $20). It's not pretty and fully integrated, but should be better than my current $80 doorbell.

Future thoughts:

If the RTSP firmware is released, I can add it into BlueIris and I can use motion detection and feed it back into Facebox. I can also have an flow that triggers the ""answering machine function""

Hopeful thoughts:

My understanding is that 2-way audio is still an issue with HA. I watched the hackershack video where they used a RPi 3 that would launch Jitsi. this could be a cool approach, however I would end up using a different camera (Wyze did enable webcam mode, but I don't see that working here or with the new v3). None of the Pi cameras looked like they would work for what I want (good low light, IR for night, and good normal light streaming when not in use as a video doorbell). Also, as I can't see for a way to have Node-Red auto-launch a teleconference software on a RPi and ask if I want to join a conference from my Android phone - this is just a pipe dream.

Issues with sensors coming thru Smartthings,"The hub for my network is Smartthings. I've integrated it with Home Assistant because I like the fine level controls I have over my smart home. Smartthings is a pretty reliable hub, but has a horrible interface.

This isn't just one type of sensor, either. I currently have several, such as the Zooz 4-in-1 sensor and a Xiaomi temp/humidity sensor. Both are showing the same behavior.

Ensuring Z-Wave plug state by monitoring power draw?,"Hi!

I've got a Fibaro Wall Plug 2 controlling a heater and have set it up using `generic_thermostat` platform. This mostly works well - except when it doesn't.

Occasionally, Home Assistant thinks the plug is turned on when it really is off. I can solve this by manually turning the switch off and on again (via Home Assistant). The problem is that by the time I discover this the temperature may have dropped by several degrees.

I'm not sure how this can even happen considering the plug is Z-Wave Plus certified, but figured a possible solution is to set up automations for toggling the switch (twice) if the power draw of the plug doesn't match the reported state.

So if Home Assistant turns on the switch, but power draw remains below some low threshold, turn it off and back on again. Perform the power draw check again, and so on. Similarly, if Home Assistant turns the switch off but power draw remains above some threshold, turn it on and off again.

This would most likely work in my setup because the heater is always set to a high temperature that its internal thermostat will never measure. However, it would be nice to have some kind of failure detection where Home Assistant won't trigger these automations endlessly if something changes (heater setting is changed, Z-Wave switch is offline, etc.).

I'm having trouble envisioning the required automations to make this all work smoothly. Ideally, I'd like for it to mostly function by itself and only notify me if something goes wrong. Maybe something along the lines of notifying if a specific automation has been triggered more than x times in the last y seconds. Or maybe combine that with a dynamic interval (for checking the power draw) that keeps increasing every time the ""fix"" doesn't work.

--------------

Anyway - would like some guidance on how to set this up efficiently.

Im Going To Do It!!,"In 6-9 months I will be purchasing a house and I want to be prepared to start my home assistant journey. I have so many questions, but I am going to try to keep it clear and concise.

Second - I have already decided I am going with Zwave. Where should I get sensors, plugs, etc from? Thinking Zooz for switches.

Third - Want to set up security devices so what cameras and equipment do I need for that?

Lastly? - Do you have people/articles that you recommend for getting introduced to and starting HA? I know there are going to be a ton of obstacles ahead so I will need to learn those from someone/thing (MQTT, Nodered, HACS, etc.)

Mysa thermostat integration - how to,"I finally got a Mysa thermostat for my in wall heaters in the main room. This heats half our home, so it was worth the cost to me.

It seemed like there was some confusion on how to set these up in HA based on reading older posts, so here is what I did, and it worked perfectly.

1. Download the Mysa app, create account, verify email, etc..
2. Install the Mysa according to your wiring (240 vs 120) &amp; power on
3. When the Mysa screen shows the big down arrow, it's in pairing mode. Open the Mysa app and follow instructions. Choose a 2.4Ghz SSID that Mysa will connect to and and enter the password. Allow phone access for what it asks for.
4. WHEN IT'S COMPLETE, **DO NOT HIT CONFIRM!** Every time I did this, the device was no longer discoverable in HA via the Homekit Controller.
   1. UPDATE: NEWER FIRMWARE VERSIONS MAY NOT REQUIRE THIS STEP.
5. In HA, if Homekit did not find it already, add a Homekit controller integration and on the dropdown select your Mysa device.
6. The Pairing Code is behind the screen of the Mysa. When you install the Mysa you have to remove the screen to install  the mounting screws. on the back of the screen panel is a QR code. Next to that is a 8 digit number. Pay attention to the format - the Homekit integration is telling you to enter the pairing code formatted like XXX-XX-XXX - this is important! Make sure to use the dashes.
7. Once the Mysa is paired in HA via the Homekit controller, go back to the Mysa App and confirm that setup is complete. So far I have full app control, and full HA control.
8. Add a climate card to the UI and test it out.
9. Use the Mysa app for more advanced settings like screen brightness.

When the setpoint is changed on the Mysa device, it updates in HA. When the setpoint is updated in HA, it updates the Mysa display. Same with the Mysa App. It all works.

If you run into any issue at all, reset the Mysa by holding up and down arrows on the screen for 10 seconds.

You DO NOT need any other Apple devices do use the Homekit controller integration.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-24 02:05:49,Mysa thermostat integration - how to,"I finally got a Mysa thermostat for my in wall heaters in the main room.

AC status in homekit," 

Hi,

Previously I had my daikin AC Wi-Fi module integrated through homebridge that showed on home app of it was cooling or heating. After moving to the home assistant integration of homekit and connecting the daikin ac to home assistant it always shows as green (doesn’t say if it is cooling or heating).

How can I solve this? I would like to be able to have the AC status showing correctly in the home app.

Ways to sense which Echo Device is Active?,"I think that one of the holy grails of smart home voice control is being able to issue location specific commands to a voice assistant like Echo. I have several echo dots placed all over the house, and one of the first things I did was place them in groups so that commands like ""turn on the lights"" only turn on the lights in a specific group.

*But for some ungodly reason that doesn't work with any other devices.* I desperately want to say ""turn on the tv"" and have only the tv in the room I'm in turn on. Same with ""open the blinds."" I haven't found any sources online where someone has managed to make this work.

Is there any possible way to get the active Echo device into an HA script via a custom Alexa skill? Anyone have this working? I have found no solutions on the software front myself.

Maybe a workaround could be sensing the power draw of each Echo with power monitoring smart plugs? Does anyone have experience with this, or know whether smart plugs detect changes in battery consumption fast enough to make it relevant to a running script?

Ikea Tradfri remote: can't use with HA via Tradfri gateway?,"Hi folks.

I just bought the Tradfri kit of three bulbs, a gateway and a remote to play with. Integration into HA was super simple but one of the things I'd like to try out is using the nifty remote to control non-Tradfri stuff I've got hooked up to HA.

It sounds like I could do this with ZHA and a serial dongle to do the Zigbee stuff, but not via the Ikea gateway. Is that correct?

The only thing that shows up for the Tradfri remote in Home Assistant is a sensor showing the battery life on it. Nothing I could use to drive automations of scene changes or the like.

"Am an existing Homebridge user, will Homeassistant be more suited to my needs?","I'm currently using Homebridge on a Pi in order to expose my 2015 (I think it is) Samsung Tizen powered TV to be visible in HomeKit, which I then use an automation to turn on the lightstrip on or off depending on its power state, the TV is too old so I can't even use HomeKit to turn the TV on/off either!

My hallway IKEA Tradfri lights are activated by either IKEA Tradfri switches and Hue motion sensors.  

I have a load of HomeKit automations which set the brightness depending on the time of day it turns on (100% bridge between sunrise and sunset and 33% bright 4 hours after sunset to sunrise), is this something I can automate with Homeassistant so the birghtness level at 10pm is 100% and as time goes on, by midnight, it will only activate at 33% then in the reverse at sunset, it will go from 33% to 100%.

Also, what happens if HA is unreachable and I switch the lights on, does it not work as HA is not reachable or does it just turn on regardless?

I'd also like to use https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting as I think IKEA are dragging their heels on supporting adaptive lighting as Hue have only just enabled this in the UK but I don't even know where to start.

For example, the MyMazda app will notify me if my trunk/doors are open, but I'm not always on my phone, so it would be nice if when I get a notification from MyMazda saying my car door is open, it would announce it through my Echo(s) and maybe flash my LIFX lights? Is this possible? I'm assuming the answer has something to do with Tasker...but I don't even know where I'd begin with being able to do this.

Of course I'd also like to branch out to other apps, like when I get a text from a certain person (or a snapchat) my lights flash, etc etc. There's a million uses but the Mazda one is my first focus.

LIFX integration error - bulbs unavailable,"Hi there, everyone

I posted this one in the HA Forum, but this community seems more active, so hopefully I'll score some help.

My LIFX bulbs have always been kind of unstable, but for the past few weeks it has been worse. My log is giving me some errors that I cannot understand, so I’m asking for some support from anyone that is more knowledgeable than me.

 [Here](https://hastebin.com/movinepoko.sql) is the log.

Some more details, if needed:

* Routers are 1x Asus AC88u (main) and 2x AC68U (AIMesh), al running MerlinWRT
* LIFX app works without any issue
* Tried removing/reinstalling the LIFX Integration - no luck
* Tried resetting all the bulbs - no luck
* Running Home Assistant on a Linux laptop (Docker)

All my bulbs are LIFX and this has been driving me insane, so huge thank you for your help in advance.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-24 00:03:04,LIFX integration error - bulbs unavailable,"Hi there, everyone  I posted this one in the HA Forum, but this community seems more active, so hopefully I'll score some help.

File Editor keeps changing file format,"Hi everyone!

I've had this issue for a while, but I recently found that it is actually breaking some of my automations. I use the web UI for the official File editor add on to edit my automations. Now, I've noticed that when I log back in sometimes, my automations are formatted differently in terms of arguments for some services. For example, I will type out

\- delay: 5

but sometimes when I open the file up it's been changed to 

\- delay: '5'

Other behavior also happens with some of my templates, which breaks them. I'm hoping someone knows something about why this is happening, or at least how I can stop the editor from modifying the file.

Problems with Bromite browser and webview on remote Android clients connected through Caddy reverse proxy. Looking for some help.,"I've narrowed down my problems to [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/).

I can't connect to my Home Assistant from any android client when trying to access it through my Caddy reverse proxy when using the Bromite browser. I have one rooted device that is using the Bromite System Webview, which makes it not possible to access using the companion app.

However, all of the devices in question have access when using the local IP address (192.168.1.XX:8123) in Bromite, and they all have reverse proxy access when using a different browser (Fennec and Vanadium, for examples).

When I navigate to my DDNS that points to my reverse proxy, Bromite will let me log in, but Home Assistant will quickly eject me and say ""Unable to connect to Home Assistant.""

Below is my reverse proxy configuration using Caddy v2. Note that I use the same header and encode settings to access other stuff on my local network (Sonarr, Radarr, Portainer, Jellyfin, Nextcloud, etc.), and all of those work fine, even in Bromite. I've tried changing the encode and header directives, but haven't found anything that changes the weird login behavior.

Is anyone using Bromite that could give me a point in the right direction? Are there any settings I should check? I've compared my Bromite settings to my Vanadium settings (another chromium-based browser that works fine when accessing Home Assistant), and they look the same. I've already tried disabling the adblocking in Bromite, which should be the primary difference between those two browsers.

I'm not sure what is making Home Assistant act different from my other services on my reverse proxy. Is there anything in my reverse proxy config that could be causing this issue on a single browser/webivew?

Anyone using Emporia Energy Vue to Monitor Home Energy Usage?,"I was saving up money to buy a Sense, but the reviews have me iffy. 

I was researching other options, and when I came across a post about the Aeotec home energy monitor, someone mentioned this product.

Looks like I can get a version that has 16 50A clamps for circuits and 2 200A clamps for the mains. 

We have a newer home (built in 2017). Everything is labeled, and 16 clamps should be plenty to monitor what I want to watch in the house.

I also came across the python repo, and this HACS integration (which has to be manually added):

I'm thinking that for $150, this really fits the bill. But I'd like to hear from some of the folks out there using it.

"Dumb switch with relay ""multi toggle"" action","Does anyone else use smart relays behind traditional switches, but want multiple actions from toggling a single dumb switch? 

I wanted to be able to turn on a main light by switch, OR have it also turn on the side lamp by the couch with a quick on-off-on toggle of the switch. I use a Shelly 1 behind the light switch. This could be done with almost anything though.

Here's what I did, but wondering if there is a better way?  This works well for me.

**1) Create a helper counter.**   
Default 0, max 2. Call this Toggle Counter or something.  it will count the toggles to the 'On' state.

**2) Create an automation to increment the counter +1**  
Every time the relay goes from off -&gt; on, you want the counter to +1, but not forever.  
Mode = parallel   
Trigger = when shelly state changes from off to on  
Action = increment the counter - call service -&gt; counter.increment   
Action = delay 5 seconds  
Action = reset the counter - call service -&gt; counter.reset

This means you have 5 seconds to flip the switch off-on again before the counter will be incremented from subsequent toggles, because you are resetting the counter back to ""0"" five seconds after every off-&gt;on action. Adjust delay as desired. 5 seconds is long, 3 should work well too. Mode= parallel allows the automation to run again without stopping the first one, so the first one will still be counting down the 5 seconds delay and reset to counter to 0 for a fresh start. For example, if it only counted 1 toggle in 5 seconds.

**3) Create another automation for your what to do when a double flip is detected**  
Trigger: When the counter changes state to 2  
Add conditions if you want.  
Action: reset the counter to 0 - call service -&gt; counter.reset  
Action: call your service for whatever action you want. I have another living room light come on with the second toggle.

With the parallel mode and the counter resets, you won't have a situation where you turn the light on later on have the secondary action trigger. You just have a few seconds for the toggles to count.

You will need a seperate toggle counter (helper)  for each switch you want to use this one. 

Anyways, this was one I hadn't come across before - and is sort of a hybrid where smart automation meets manual control.

Could be useful for something like opening the garage door as you walk into the garage with a quick double flick of the light switch too.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 19:46:00,"Dumb switch with relay ""multi toggle"" action","Does anyone else use smart relays behind traditional switches, but want multiple actions from toggling a single dumb switch?

Any way to run HA in High Availability configuration when using Z-wave?,"As the title implies, my HA install manages my Z-wave network. Currently I am running it with [Hass.io](https://Hass.io) on a RPi 4, but would prefer to move it into my Proxmox cluster to take advantage of live migrations, fully automated backups managed by Proxmox, much more durable storage, etc. The only issue I have is the fact that I need to have the Z-wave stick mounted to the VM to managed the Z-wave network. Mounting the USB stick isn't a problem, but if the VM is moved/failed over to a different physical host, the physical stick cannot follow.

Will this work?,"Hi, this is my 1st time posting. I have Home assistant with 100+ devices connected to it using Rpi4. I just bought a UPS back up power just to avoid my rpi cut off from power. My home power occasionally tripped(not sure why, and not always, however it tripped 2 nights ago before i bought the UPS, thankfully my rpi home assistant started up fine, phew!)

So i made an automation in node red that if my sonoff switches become unavailable (few switches, the only way i know if there is a power trip due to my network will be cut off due to it) it will then check an input boolean if its on(using helper input boolean named auto shutdown rpi) if its true or on then it will continue on and switch off that input boolean and continue again to call service to shut down the rpi.

The main reason i put input boolean(named auto shutdown) is to avoid the rpi to shutdown again after booting it up incase the switches(sonoff switches) is still connecting to the network and still unavailable. 

This is not tested yet. Question im asking is, will this work? My ups system is not a smart ups. it just continues on powering the appliances connected to it if power fails. and if power fails i wont be able to access my home assistant due to rpi will not be connected to the network(no power) so i made this automation to shut it down automatically.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 12:57:44,Will this work?,"Hi, this is my 1st time posting.

And, since I already have two Zigbee devices (Xiami/Aqara) working with Conbee II + Home Assistant on Raspberry Pi 4, I thought it could be useful for it to be Zigbee, and not Wi-Fi, so this way it could act as a Zigbee signal repeater and hopefully bring the Zigbee signal further into the other side of the apartment so that I can get more and more Zigbee devices in other areas of the apartment in the near future.

What to use for commercial garage door opener,"I have a commercial garage door opener in my shop that is the Liftmaster MT. It uses a 3 button wired remote (Open, Stop, Close) that is wired into the com, open, stop, close ports on the main unit. It has a black learning button which I have been able to use without issue in pairing with my vehicles.

I have tried the myQ hub but their software works with several different colored learning buttons but does not list black as an option. Their phone support said they don’t think it works with their “commercial” openers.

My attached garage uses a GoControl which I recently got working however it being 2 wire I didn’t see how that would work with the Shop opener.

Any ideas on what I can use to open/close and monitor the status of the door? I would prefer a wifi solution as I have wifi in the shop however would consider a zwave product but would need to add a hub. My HA and zwave dongle are not within range of the shop.

I have started looking at the shelly 2.5 but wasn’t sure if that will work or even the best option.

Thank you in advance.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 15:55:12,What to use for commercial garage door opener,"I have a commercial garage door opener in my shop that is the Liftmaster MT.

ZHA: Aqara battery reporting,"Hey everyone, 

I'm using a flashed Sonoff ZB bridge with the ZHA component.

I have noticed that the aqara/xiaomi motion, contact sensors and buttons all report 100% battery, except of two of them that report 92%. (I'm using the old xiaomi versions of the sensors)

I tried searching everywhere but I cannot find a solution to this, not a recent one that I can follow.

Wrong Colour on IKEA Trådfri bulbs,"Im using HassOS 5.4 with Supervisor 118.x and latest Deconz using Conbee II.

When i change color i get the wrong colours. Yellow is greenish and blue has a weird tint. It worked well with the Trådfri gateway integration.

Zwave/Wifi/... Thermostat,"I'm searching for something, but I cannot find the thing I needed. Or not enough information to know if it does what i want.

I'm building a complete system for my central heating using home assistant and some custom electronics. The system work with 8 central valves allowing hot water to flow through the radiators.  At the moment I have different 5/6 zone's. This al works fine from within home assistant ( took my long enough :p )!

To have I easily accessible for my wife and kids, I want some thermostats to install in my house. These are the features I'm looking for:

* Wireless
* They can send the current temperature of the room to home assistant
* Able to change the target temperature from the thermostat and send it to home assistant
* Allow home assistant to change the target temperature and send it to the thermostat. So you can see on the thermostat what the target temperature is.
* I would also like the ability to change some status icon's on the thermostat. 
   * Is the room currently been heated?
   * Is the valve open?
   * ...

I have no need for a relay or schedule in the thermostat itself, because all of that is been taken care of in home assistant.

Hopefully somebody has an idea :)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 07:41:45,Zwave/Wifi/... Thermostat,"I'm searching for something, but I cannot find the thing I needed.

How to make this automation work with kodi's weird behavior?,"I have an automation that runs a lighting script when kodi starts playing music (and only music, not videos). The trigger is a state change of media_player.kodi to ""playing"" from any state. It has a condition to check that the state attribute 'media.content_type' is 'music.' this all works as expected so far.

The problem comes when switching from one song to the next. If song1.flac is playing and finishes then song2.flac starts, the state of media_player.kodi stays at ""playing"" throughout the track change and the automation is not re-triggered. But if song1.flac is playing and I skip to the next track, kodi's state briefly changes from playing to idle then back to playing. That's enough to re-trigger the automation, potentially sending too many service calls to my yeelight bulbs in too short a time if I'm skipping several tracks.

How can I work around this? Use something else for the trigger? Is there a way to ignore momentary state changes? 'idle' is also the state used when kodi is stopped so I can't ignore that state completely, only when it's been in idle for less than 1 second then changes to playing.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 11:12:38,How to make this automation work with kodi's weird behavior?,"I have an automation that runs a lighting script when kodi starts playing music (and only music, not videos).

Struggling with strings in ESPHome display lambda,"Hi folks.

I'm trying to pass through a string into my epaper display but I'm struggling with C++ string handling. I admit to knowing not nearly enough about C++ so I'm blundering my way through here with copypasta and little understanding.

All I want is to get the current weather state onto the display. I've got floats like temperature and humidity working great.

So I've defined a string (well it sure looks like a string, current value ""rainy"") sensor as:

    sensor:
      - platform: homeassistant
        entity_id: sensor.openweathermap_condition
        id: openweathermap_condition

And then I go to use it in the lambda:

    display:
      - platform: waveshare_epaper
        update_interval: 60s
        cs_pin: 15
        dc_pin: 27
        busy_pin: 25
        reset_pin: 26
        model: 4.20in
        lambda: |-
          if (id(openweathermap_condition).has_state()) {
            it.printf(5, 160, id(font20), ""Condition: %s"", id(openweathermap_condition).c_str());
          }

And when I go to compile it I get this:

    src/main.cpp: In lambda function:
    src/main.cpp:509:78: error: 'class esphome::homeassistant::HomeassistantSensor' has no member named 'c_str'
             it.printf(5, 180, font20, ""Condition: %s"", openweathermap_condition-&gt;c_str());

Some help needed for new RPi 4 + SSD setup,"I'm using HA for over a month now (RPi 3 + sd card) and its working nicely. Before christmas I'm planning to upgrade my setup for more long term usage. I want to follow the advice from this sub and switch to an ssd setup.

My current planned components:

* Raspberry Pi 4 8GB
* official power supply
* ELUTENG USB 3.0 to SATA adapter (I read that this one is the most reliable currently?)
* Crucial BX500 240GB SSD

I'm still not sure which case I should use for the RPi 4. Any recommendations? Not sure if active or passive cooling is needed and there are a lot of different cases available.

Also do I need some case for the SSD or do I just connect it via the dapter, put it next to the RPi 4 and call it a day?

Flashing Home Assistant to Dell Wyse 7020,"I'm in a bit of a situation.  I purchased a Wyse 7020 to install HA on a 256 ssd.  I upgraded the ram from 4 to 8 and removed the 16gb flash ssd and installed a 256 ssd.  I did the recommended install by using the Ubuntu route.  By temporarily using Ubuntu and plugging in another USB with NUC image to install.

Everything to this point is fine, but when I get to the step to install the image in terminal.  Terminal briefly pauses and gives results of an install.  That's it!  Is there another step?  When I go off the guidelines and power off remove usb drives and it reads "" home assistant will install"".  But after the restart the Wyse loops. 

How can I get this to successfully load HA?  Did I miss a step?   FYI, The installed ssd has the nuc image unloaded on it.

HA notification target for desktop Linux?,"I'm looking for a way to get HA notifications on my Ubuntu desktop.  I'd like define a notification target in HA and send the notifications that way.  My desktop is a different system on the same network.  I'm not looking for HTML5 notifications or anything that depends on a web browser being open on my desktop.


On the desktop side, what I had in mind would be akin to other generic notifications, like where NetworkManager sends its notifications.  For example, when I connect to a network, a notification bubble pops up at the top right of my desktop saying ""Successfully connected to X"".  I want HA notifications to produce desktop notifications like that.


Looking at https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/#notifications , nothing jumped out at me, although I'm unfamiliar with most of the technologies and services listed there.  Growl ( https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/gntp/ ) looks like maybe a good fit?  On my desktop, I'd need to setup a GNTP server and somehow integrate that with the notification indicator.  I'm just spitballing - I don't know off the top of my head how to accomplish it.


In principle I understand that it'd probably be trivial to setup a websocket listener and listen for all events, filter on the client, and produce notifications that way.  I'd be interested to know if anyone's doing that, but that's not ideally what I'm looking for.


Are there any easy wins that are available to me?


edit: bonus points if the solution doesn't depend on 3rd party services etc.  I'm looking for a single LAN connection.  I'd even consider doing something with SMTP but that seems a bit heavy-handed for what I want to accomplish, since it'd require both a mail server and client.

Question about trying OpenZwave(beta) as a second parallel zwave instance,"So, I've searched....and I can't seem to find an answer.  I'm sure I've missed it somewhere.

I have HA installed on an Ubuntu server in my basement (unsupported, I know) and have been using a remotely located RPi with a Nortek HUSBZB-1 as my zwave/zigbee ""hub"" via a USB over IP service.  I use HA's native Zwave and Zigbee integrations, and for the most part, everything works fine......aside from the service not restarting automatically on the Pi after a power outage.

I've been wanting to try out the OpenZwave integration instead, but I've got a LOT of zwave devices on my network, and I'm not interested in moving everything over right away.  I have a second HUSBZB-1 and was wondering if I can plug that into another Pi, install the OpenZwave integration in HA, and have both sticks working at the same time.

Anyone else have issues with their theme's background image after a recent HA update?,"I have a few themes installed currently. Ever since an update recently (I want to say it was .116 but could be off), the background image for all the themes don't work.

What additional platform for more advanced control?,"OK, so I'm looking for a platform that will allow me to do more advanced automations more easily.

When the door is closed, return the light to its last state.

***What platform(s) would you recommend for more advanced decision-making like this?***

I could pretty much code this all out easily in C++:

1. Rescale 6:30AM-Sunset to 0-1
2. Use the 0-1 value to interpolate between 2 or more colors throughout the day
3. Each minute: All lights color = circadian color
4. Each light has a struct that contains the current color, brightness, and override bit
5. Each light also has a copy of the struct that contains a backup value.

For themes:

1. If I request a theme, it sets the override bit to ignore the circadian schedule.
2. Reset the bit when requesting restored lighting and retrigger circadian lighting
3. Each morning, the circadian bit is reset

For the doors:

1. When a door is opened, current state -&gt; backup state
2. override = true. color = red
3. When door is closed again, backup state -&gt; current state

Easy peasy, and I would be able to perform this as an array that is auto-generated from the complete list of lights.

But just *imagine* trying to do this in YAML. Absolutely unusable for advanced decision-making.

The closest I can think of is node-red. But even node-red has trouble thinking about things like data flow, arrays, global variables, etc. It seems to prefer events and hard-coded values. For instance, I can't even recall ""sunset time"", because the sunrise component only seems to return trigger events AT sunrise and sundown, rather than giving me the actual numbers at any time. Certainly doable, but it seems like most of these GUI solutions add more complexity than they resolve.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-23 04:10:48,What additional platform for more advanced control?,"OK, so I'm looking for a platform that will allow me to do more advanced automations more easily.

"Anyone have experience with linking ""Ecovacs Robot Vacuum OZMO920"" (or similar) to HA?","The wife has been encouraging me to get a robo vacuum, which is great, but one of my deal-breakers is that it connects well with HA. One of hers is apparently that it mops as well as vacuums.

MQTT JSON with special caracters ?,"Hello guys,

I'm requesting some help: I'm completly stuck on that ! I'm going crazy

I have this MQTT payload coming from a device that monitors my solar panel.

My goal is to get the temperature from DS18B20-1 sensor.

I tried example from the MQTT doc but without success.

I've done some experimenting in template editor with that :

`{% set value_json = {""Time"":""2020-11-22T12:24:47"",""DS18B20-1"":{""Id"":""05178020D8FF"",""Temperature"":61.1},""DS18B20-2"":{""Id"":""0517806665FF"",""Temperature"":38.7},""Temperature_Solar"":39,""Temperature_Tank"":34,""Current_Pump"":0,""Current_Heater"":0,""TempUnit"":""C""}`

`%}`

`{{ value_json.DS18B20-1.Temperature }}` 

&amp;#x200B;

The output is:

 `UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'DS18B20'` 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems that the dash in the name ""DS18B20**-**1"" is not recognised correctly and split the name!

&amp;#x200B;

For moment, here's my configuration.yaml, that obviously not working  :

  `- platform: mqtt`

`name: ""Tank up temperature""`

`device_class: temperature`

`state_topic: ""tele/cel/sol/SENSOR""`

`unit_of_measurement: '°C'`

`value_template: ""{{ value_json.TEmperature }}""`

HA loses connection with Homematic IP blinds,"Hey, 

for some reason, every blind actuator I use always loses connection with the Homematic hub and therefore isn't available in Home Assistant.

Due to this, I cannot use them in solo in Home Assistant, which I would like to do. Anybody have any idea what's going on?

Amcrest AD110 Doorbell - any idea on when we will get more integration?,"Does anyone have any word/rumors about when we will get more Amcrest integration? 

I can use motion detect to trigger flows in NR - but if I try and take a snapshot with the doorbell camera - it does nothing. Almost seems like when motion detection is trigger inside the camera that locks up the RTSP for a few seconds (things become ""unavailable"". 

Clear -&gt; Detected -&gt; Unavailable -&gt; Clear

Sort of weird. I also tried https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-amcrest-ad110 and didn't get very far. The snapshot node didnt work for me and the monitor node throws a lot of HTTP 400 errors (I tried ""Use RAW codes""). Shame this pallete doesn't have documentation and it seems like only a few dozen people have tried it out.

Couple this lack of integration with the fact that brightness won't shift if a person is in a shadow and approaching the door (and lack of brightness control in general) and that you can't disable motion detection alerts without disabling the ""alert me if someone presses the doorbell"" - and I really think I may need to find a new product But, again, with better HA integration I can get past all of this. I would love to use HA to manage the 2-way intercom instead of the app. I would love to get it working better with Facebox so that photos are stored when someone the system doesn't recognize approaches, etc.

Newbie question about hardware to start with,"I've been thinking about starting with Home Assistant for a while and I'm now ready to take the plunge. I realize Raspberry Pi seems to be the common starting point for base hardware but I also see people talking about later upgrading because the Pi no longer meets their needs.

What components are most important for those upgrading from a Pi? I have an older mini PC that was previously used as a media server so I'm trying to decide whether I get started on that or on a Raspberry Pi. The Pi would be preferred since it's much smaller and more energy efficient.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-21 18:07:20,Newbie question about hardware to start with,"I've been thinking about starting with Home Assistant for a while and I'm now ready to take the plunge.

Home Assistant freezing my PC,"Hey everyone,

I'm a bit stuck, it seems my home assistant has managed to start messing up overnight. I launch it via the virtual machine on my PC, normally via the vm service in the background and today It's started freezing my computer to making it almost entirely non responsive as soon as it reaches the ""started"" phase. I've made no changes overnight to cause this. I installed the new HA earlier in the week &amp; reset and reinstalled my ring doorbell into its app yesterday but neither resulted in errors at least not that i noticed.

So far I've tried:- Updating the oracle virtual machine to its latest version

\- Updating the extensions pack to its latest version

\- Increasing the amount of ram the virtual machine has access to

\- Removing the animated wallpaper from my home assistant

\- Removing the ring integration from the home assistant.

I have a i7 6700K and 32gb of ram on my pc so this shouldn't be an issue. It was working fine previously

Anyone have any ideas?

Sensor Integration for Owlet Smart Sock v2/v3 ( Using Modern Owlet API ),"Hey folks,   


I recently got an Owlet Smart Sock for my son, and was annoyed by the fact that I couldn't view the statistics from anywhere other than a mobile phone app. Particularly, I wanted to be able to graph them so I could see trends and whatnot, because that's just who I am. Anyhow, I made a custom HA integration to allow me to collect the data via HA + scrape with Prometheus + graph in Grafana, and figured I'd share.   


[https://github.com/jlamendo/ha-sensor.owlet](https://github.com/jlamendo/ha-sensor.owlet)  


Grafana Graphs:   


[I don't have these uploaded anywhere at the moment, but I'll be glad to do so if requested.](https://preview.redd.it/dspcog0naj061.png?width=1221&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=934128193d790249dd34c47a0fb5b55dd1723050)

It's not perfect by any means - there have been a few times when it's locked up, and I'm not sure if it's my fault or Owlet's. The default scan interval is set to 10s, please don't set it any faster - I don't want to abuse their undocumented API and have access revoked for all of us. As a bonus, though, having the data gathered this way does allow you to track and graph things like movement as a % rather than just the boolean ""%s is wiggling"" that the app gives you.  


I would have liked to submit it for inclusion as an actual integration, but there are two issues with that:  
\#1. Integrations have to have API libraries as separate Python libraries. I could do this with relatively low effort, but alas, I have a 1-month-old baby and don't really have the time to spare.  
\#2. It's setup to only be configurable via YAML. Personally, I prefer this, but the new HA guidelines state that all new integrations must be configured via the GUI, in order to make it more friendly towards less technical users.   


If anybody wants to take a shot at resolving those issues so it can be used by more people, PR's are welcome. Otherwise, instructions for installation are in the README, and if you reach out to me I'll be glad to provide what little support I can with the kinds of spare time a new parent has :D   


A side note on #2 - I've been in software development professionally for 7 years now, and I'll be honest, I've never seen an API that was so confusing, difficult to use, and poorly documented as the GUI config setup. I'm sure it's not a problem for old hat HA devs or those who specialize in Python, but in an attempt to make things more friendly to less-technically inclined users, it has made things much less friendly to new integration developers. And the end result there is that if you want to use this and belong in that ""less technical"" camp, it's probably going to be a bit of a pain to install if you haven't installed a custom component yet.

My experience moving from a Pi4 install to a NUC.,"It was incredibly straightforward and mostly issue-free. I downloaded the NUC image from the HomeAssistant site, plugged the MSata drive from my NUC into a USB MSATA adapter (£10 from Amazon) and flashed, the first flash didn’t seem to work but extracting the image file first and flashing with that did the trick - that might have been some random issue on my end because it makes no sense at all.

HA booted with HDMI output and appeared on my network as Homeassistant, I installed the Samba addon, deleted the default config directory and copied my config directory directly over the network while HA was running  and reinstalled my other Addons - MQTT Broker, File Editor etc. Plugged in my RFlink box via USB and everything just worked - I obviously needed to point my Tasmota devices to the new NUC HA IP.

This is just a reassurance to anyone mulling over such a move that it’s straightforward.

"Will ""delay"" be interrupted?","Hey. For dummies, please. If you use delay in an automation, will another automation interrupt (and stop) that delay? I'm asking this because I made an automation that had a 30 minute delay before carrying out an action and I see that action was never carried out. All I can think of is that actually during that delay there was another automation that carried out an action. Could that be the cause of the delay apparently stopping and never carrying out the following action?

Could this have to do with the modes (single, restart, etc.)? Or is that not relevant because in this case we're talking about an action from a different automation?

Trying to understand Zigbee/Zwave offline control,"Hi Reddit,  


Long time lurker first time poster. I'm a complete NoOb to HA but I;m ready to jump in the deepend after a number of VERY frustrating experiences over the past couple of months with a Smart home built entirely around the SmartThings ecosystem.   


So now that I've made the decision I figure its go BIG or go home. So if I'm going to put in the effort to setup my HA I would like to control my whole house completely offline. So my biggest question here is if I currently rely on my ST hub to be the brain of my Zigbee/Zwave smart home, and the ST hub relies on being online to control devices how then can I set up a new HA install that controls all my devices without the need for internet connection?   


I will look to run HA on an old (always on) Intel NUC Mini PC that I've had lying around so that this is a dedicated machine for this purpose and this purpose only. So my question is should I be looking to attach a USB Zigbee/Zwave stick to this machine or am I over complicating things and should just use my existing hub. I also have a UPS (uninterupted power supply) that I intend to plug this into so that it hopefully never goes down regardless of if the power goes out or internet isn't working. I'm also hoping this will allow faster return to normal when all other smart devices come back up after a power outage (no need to wait for PC/HA to reboot).   


I'd love some input from anyone currently running HA on a PC and anything you ""wish someone had told you"" as a noob. As well as any recomendations on best USB Zigbee/ZWave sticks if thats a recomendation that someone more learned than myself is willing to offer.

Home Assistant fans - what is the best way you've found to secure your devices?,"Hey everyone! Looking to get an open discussion going on the easiest/most-secure way each of you secure your devices.

For context, I initially started securing my Tuya-based devices by taking them off my personal 2GHz WLAN and moving each device to a 'Guest' network. I then realized I should probably change all of the passwords entered into each device into something that isn't a password I use on other platforms (stupid past me). Ultimately, I've realized that perhaps the best way to 'secure' these devices is to take all of these individual lightbulbs, sensors, and apps offline, a la Home Assistant.

For starters, I tried localizing my devices by going the Tasmota route on one of my door sensors - and wasn't successful (probably bricked it lol). Even though I have a lot of experience with a soldering iron, the prospect of popping open every lightbulb and sensor I have in my apartment to flash them via serial wasn't very appealing.

I did see that some devices come with Tasmota preloaded on them, but has anyone here had success with those? Do they have the same out-of-the-box functionality as other purchasable devices, or do they feel like 'hacked' devices? I have minimal experience with Tasmota, so really not sure what to expect, and honestly its not appealing to replace every device in my home either :)

I can't help but think there must be other methods others use, which brings me to this discussion! 

So: What are some of your go-to ways to secure your devices? Do you even secure them at all, do you simply use a guest WiFi to connect, or do you flash Tasmota via hard-wiring? Very curious to hear what the best methods are :)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-20 17:14:01,Home Assistant fans - what is the best way you've found to secure your devices?,"Hey everyone!

Load Cells vs Thin Film Pressure Sensor for bed occupancy?,"I (perhaps somewhat over ambitiously) ordered a pack of load cells and amplifier after reading a few articles about using them as a bed presence sensor.  Really like the idea of enabling under bed lighting when I'm coming home late and my gf is asleep.

But I also saw, yesterday (the day the load cells came in) people using thin film pressure sensors, under the mattress.  This brings up a few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

Pros and Cons of the two?

Can I put the load cells under the mattress?  I have an expensive vintage Broyhill headboard, I don't really like the idea of having 3D Printed holders and wires stretching visibly under the bed.

"I want to make my dumb dehumidifier smart, how to emulate a button press?","Hey all, I have several devices which I want to smarten up but unfortunately they don't automatically turn on when plugged in so I can't use a smart plug. They require a button press to turn on and I was wondering if anyone here has converted a dumb device into a smart one. The two devices I have in mind at the moment is my electric blanket and dehumidifier. I want to have a sensor tell home assistant that it's too humid and have home assistant automatically turn on my dehumidifier for 2 hours.

I know there exists ready made button pressers but I want a project and to do this cheaply. If I expose the circuit board and find the momentary switch which turns the device on, what are my options to emulate a button press, or the convert it into a toggle switch?

The guy at ""the hook up"" used a optocoupler with a wemos d1 mini to make make a pool controller and I was wondering if that would work for a dehumidifier and if that's best practice. Would a relay be better? Solenoid? Any other ideas?

Super Excited to have gotten Windows HotKeys to perform Home Assistant automations,"So I wanted to use my keyboard to trigger lighting scenes in home assistant, so I went looking for a solution (man do I love the forums and all the amazing work so many have done and shared). It was actually pretty simple to set up hotkeys that publish to MQTT/mosquitto. The last part is of course writing automations that are triggered by that MQTT topic.  I also stored the HotKey definition file in a dropbox folder so that it's easy to keep any PC's with this function enable with all of the same customizations.

My original Idea was to have holding the Home key + the #1 on my keyboard set ""Scene 1"" and maybe Home+0 puts the house into the Goodnight Scene.  But as I got started, I kept thinking of new ones to make - curious what everyone else can come up with.  My goal was to make the shortcut itself intuitive enough that I have very little to keep memorized in my head.  At this point I've got

Home+1 = Lighting Scene X

Home+G+1 = Open or close Garage Door 1 (I can safely see my garage from my desk chair, Garage doors can be very dangerous to put into automations - for this reason, I may not actually use this idea)

Home+M = Mute any/all playing Sonos zones in the house

Home+Esc = Mute all Sonos zones, Pause Smart TV, Mute Desktop Amp, Turn on all house lights

Person location is not updating. Always shows Home.,"New HA user, got everything setup but the home / away feature does not seem to work with me or my wife . The details

- both using Pixel phones (4a and 5)
- both registered app, all sensors enabled, location is on background all the time
- linked device.tracker.pixel to each person
- I can see most the other sensors work, eg charging and notifications. They change in HA in real time and the history is accurate
- geocoded location and a few other items  never change though. Just always show as our house, even in the history when I know we have been away and I've opened the HA app

About flash memory,"Hi,

I never had problems with sd cards, but now that i'm done experimenting with HA, I'm thinking about replacing my HA sd card with an ssd.

I can no longer reach the the HA interface by any means,"HA installed on a Pi4 (migrated from a Pi3B+)

All was well, until a short while after I upgraded to the Pi4. Fresh install of HA on a new SD card, and then restored settings from a backup of the 3B+ system. It worked perfectly for a few days, then it became completely unresponsive – the system turns on, appears to boot (from the LED activity), and even shows up on my router as 'homeassistant' (ethernet into a switch).

However any attempt to access by either app or webportal fails, and none of its automations are occurring. I cannot shell into it. I bought a damn micro HDMI adapter and plugged in a screen and keyboard... nothing.

So I got clean SD card, flashed with the most recent HA build, with the intent of again restoring from the backup I still have from the 3B+.

"MQTT, ESP8266 and WiFi Denial of Service Issues","I am suffering from a random combination of issues and i am struggling to find out the cause. Apologies for the long(ish) post so bare with me.

My set up is that i have a number of sensors set up with Wemos D1 Mini pushing updates to an MQTT Server (mosquito) running on my Pi 4 with SSD also running Home Assistant. The D1 Mini are all connected over wifi to my 2.4GHz band on my ASUS RT-AC66U router. Home Assistant and the Pi are connected directly to the router over a fixed link.

Over the past few weeks my 2.4GHz would completely die and all devices connected would fail, I ordered a replacement router connected it all up set my SSIDs the same, my devices would reconnect and a few mins later the 2.4GHz band would fail again... this was an odd coincidence, the new router was a Netgear R7000.

Eventually after resetting a number of devices i got the network back up and it was stable again for a week, until the issue happened again.

I have slowly increased the number of D1 Mini devices (currently only 4) over lockdown and my wifi issues have gotten progressively worse.

Checking some of the device logs it seems to be occasionally losing connectivity to the mosquito broker on the Pi and then finally it would lose connection to the wifi. When i removed one of the devices (a motion sensor) the wifi came back up within minutes, which again was odd coincidence, could the Wemos minis be causing a denial of service on the wifi they are meant to be connecting to?

I have done my absolute best to optimise the code and to only push MQTT updates when there is a status change, or on devices where that doesnt happen frequently i have added delays to the loops so it updates every few seconds.

I had never suffered a local wifi issue prior to September when i first began to create my own IoT devices and sensors but i don't understand how these devices could be taking down my own wifi. The 5GHz remains perfectly stable without issue (none of the Wemos are connected to that band as they only have 2.4GHz antennas).

I have since removed all devices off the network and i am going to slowly introduce them back to see if i can correlate the events better. Perhaps the MQTT server is getting too many messages, but my Pi is connected directly to the router and isn't using Wifi. Or it could just be the devices are hitting the router hard with requests and crashing the 2.4GHz band. The fact a totally different router from Netgear has the same issue makes me think that a device is causing it.

So my question to the community... has anyone had any wifi issues when using Wemos sensors over MQTT? Is there an alternative method i could send and receive updates from devices rather than MQTT? Or is there a maximum number of devices or messages that i should try and limit sending?

Totally confused with this.

Delay/Unresponsive behaviour when moving between views,"Hi there,

I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing a delay/lag, unresponsive behaviour when moving between different views in their HA? I can see the URL change but the page does not or click on elements simply does nothing.

For weeks I've been trying to pin down the culprit by removing certain components, elements from views, clearing browser cache etc.

I've checked in both HA logs (tail -f home-assistant.log) and watching either Chrome or Firefox inspector tab to see what is causing the delay but I can't seem to figure it out! 

I've increase the RAM for the VM to 5GB and given it an extra core but still getting the same result?! 

The only thing I can think of it maybe due to the amount of 'custom' cards I have on each view? I must admit I am a big fan of the 'custom:button-card' and use it on every page to organise and create the layout I want.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-20 22:32:24,Delay/Unresponsive behaviour when moving between views,"Hi there,  I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing a delay/lag, unresponsive behaviour when moving between different views in their HA?

Coming from SmartThings (via Wink),"I'm moving into a new house next month and am leaving my old IoT devices and SmartThings hub with the new owners of my current home. I really like the layouts that I've been seeing here with HA, Tileboard, Magic Mirror, etc so I am planning on building out the new environment based on HA.

First question: Will a mini with a Intel N3450 be powerful enough for the HA server? I expect to use the GoControl HUSBZB-1 radio with it. Any issues here?

Second question: I haven't dug too far into the cool layout/displays. I see that HA does serve up a WebUI. I plan on having at least two (up to 4) different screen locations.  The screen size will vary widely so I don't want them all to present the same content.  Does HA allow for different endpoints to have separate rendering agents or is all of that done at the server and presented in the WebUI the same at each endpoint? I hope the question is clear.

Change color coding for led stripes over zha,"I just got two really nice led zigbee light stripes that I wanted to put around my living room. I than figured out I just need one zigbee receiver to do what I wanted to do and have one left to make one stripe smart, that currently isn't.

Open Z-Wave,"I just started to use homeassistant a month ago. Moving off smartthings. 

Had some issues getting z-wave setup but was pretty close. Had about 7 devices connected but then it all fell apart. Shelved it and came back to start from scratch with a new Z-stick. 

The normal z-wave addon that I used last time is not there any more. My only option is open z-wave beta. Is this what we have to use now? Haven't had much luck at all with it. I have an Aotec Gen5 plugged into my PC with VirtualBox setup. I've got it to recognize it.  I haven't got anything else to pair yet. I've tried both just using the ""Add node"" in configuration as well as taking the stick out. 

I end up seeing nodes with an ID and it just has the Query Stage as ""Probe"" and it never progresses from there. Am I doing something wrong?

I installed MQTT broker but haven't done anything with it. Is there something else to do here? The documentation mentioned omzdaemon installed and running in your network, was confused on this. Do I need to install that on my vm? Not super familiar with vmware of dockers.

DS18B20 Probe,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

Bought a Sonoff TH16 &amp; DS18B20 to help me monitor my garage freezer.  Last winter the garage got so cold the freezer stopped cooling for awhile so I just want to be able to monitor it closer.

So I got everything hooked up and connected to HA, my real question is in regards  to the probe placement.  Can it just dangle or does it need some type of thermal buffer for an accurate reading?  It's currently dangling off the wall towards the side and the temp is reading higher then I would expect.  The probe wire is also currently just putting between the door, so I know I should probably drill a hole to run the probe.

control ralais over MQTT and homeassistant,"Hey there.

My plan is to automate my home with a raspberry PI as a central server. The PI should control everything (homeassistant). This happens over mqtt ( Smart plugs ...) and over relais ( with the gpios of the pi). Is there a possibility to teach the alexa/googleThing(dont know the name) that when I say e.g. ""Switch the leight off"" that the alexa/googlewhatever forwards the message to the broker? So basically the alexa/googlesmartstuffthingy works only as the voice interface.  
Has anyone a idea how to integrate the railais via the mqtt broker correctly, or do i have to code it on my own?   
The plan would be here that I have some kind of pythonscript that works as an mqtt client ( which is connected to the local mashine). Like the alexa tells the homeassistant ""light off"" the homeassitant sends it to the locally installed broker and the broker forwards it to the also locally running python script, which activates the ralais. It this the way to go or can i go more efficent?

Checking the SleepyQ github page, there was previously a workaround used by the Hubitat folks (specifying a user agent string) but that doesn't do more than get past the login issue.  Subsequent API calls fail with a 403.

Doing a bit of research, the Homebridge SleepIQ plugin had a comment posted five days ago saying that the author received a request from the SleepIQ folks to take his plugin down.  Apparently, API requests were swamping their portal and impacting their ""legitimate"" user base.

Are there ANY good Z-wave motion sensors??,"I'll start with context. I already have an [ecolink PIR motion sensor](https://www.zwaveproducts.com/products/z-wave-plus-easy-install-with-pet-immunity-motion-detector-white) and love it. Battery life is awesome, even with me triggering it all day long, but it's a bit ugly, bulky, and doesn't have a pivot mount which is what I prefer in some locations. I also have 2 [Aeotec Trisensors](https://aeotec.com/z-wave-motion-sensor/), which I am happy that have motion, temperature and light sensors.....but I've completely given up on them. Batteries are only lasting 3-4 days before they are dead. I've looked at firmware updates, config changes, location changes...nothing seems to work so I am ready to move on from those....but I much prefer their appearance to that of the ecolink. Also for their price point, I would have expected much better performance which make me think trying their multisensor 6 would also be a waste of time and money.

At this point I think I've seen almost ever other motion sensor on the market and most seem to have some other drawback, like requiring a special hub (aqara) or have led indicator lights that can't be turned off (Zooz?). I am using a smartthings hub at present and right now at least, would rather not go down the usb dongle route for the time being. 

Am open to new ideas where people are finding success with their motion sensors. Critical to me would be multi-month batt life, responsitivity, an pref smartthings compatibility.

If all else fails, I may just get more ecolinks and attach the pivot mounts from the Trisensors to the ecolinks. Still, all the products I see available today are a few years old, disappointed that I don't see any more new sensors out there.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-19 19:27:15,Are there ANY good Z-wave motion sensors??,"I'll start with context.

How I made the cheapest home cctv system with Wyze Cams and HLS,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wxiiiwyuk4061.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dea2827df40213e9bb6dbd1bc5683508053c3ae

Hello there. I would like to share my experience with making the cheapest home cctv system.

I'm a fan of WyzeCams and was trying to fit it into my smart home system for a while.

It's super cheap and specs are pretty good, but the only flaw is not stable RTSP firmware.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a solution that allows you to convert mp4 files from NFS to HLS stream.

That HLS stream could be fed to any modern video surveillance system.

Here is the URL to my repo: [https://github.com/n1ckyrush/wyzecam-hls](https://github.com/n1ckyrush/wyzecam-hls)

It's pretty simple nodejs script with ffmpeg.

It's based on NFS hack (props to the original author!), you will find all instructions inside my repo.

&amp;#x200B;

After many months of fighting with RTSP and Wyze now it works flawlessly.

Hopefully it will make somebody life easier ✊

Feel free to shoot me any questions.

P.S. If you are interested in my whole journey with it, I made a long post about it: [https://n1ckyrush.com/en/blog/3-how-to-make-wyzecam-stream-stable-hls-instead-of-rtsp](https://n1ckyrush.com/en/blog/3-how-to-make-wyzecam-stream-stable-hls-instead-of-rtsp)",r/homeassistant,2020-11-19 04:14:29,How I made the cheapest home cctv system with Wyze Cams and HLS,"​     Hello there.

Trouble with the Android Companion App,"I have one device I'm having problems with logging into Home Assistant on, and I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.

I have three android devices, all with the 3.0.0-minimal version of the app installed from F-Droid. None of them are ordinary devices, but two of them are working while one isn't, and I'm trying to figure that one out.

1. Pixel 3 with GrapheneOS (no Google Play Services) connected to an always-on VPN. Working fine connected to my Home Assistant over a reverse proxy with DuckDNS.
2. Galaxy S7 that's been majorly debloated and Google Play Services blocked using Netguard. No VPN here. Working fine connected directly to Home Assistant using local IP and port.
3. Galaxy Tab S3, rooted with Google Play Services removed, connected to the same always-on VPN. This one isn't working.

The weird thing is, I can connect to Home Assistant using the reverse proxy on the Galaxy Tab. Both in the app and in a browser, I can connect to the server and log in, but about 10 seconds after logging in, something happens and it just says ""Unable to connect to Home Assistant"".

I don't want to report this as a bug until I know it's not something wrong with my configuration, but I'm struggling to diagnose this problem, because nothing is showing up in the logs about the attempted access.

Any ideas?

Edit: I think I have the source of the problem narrowed down.

Need some help flashing Tasmota to a new MagicHome RGB LED controller,"I got Tasmota working on some older MagicHome controllers, but I've since ordered a new batch of them and can't seem to get the flash to work.

Non-Cloud Thermostats,"I'm looking for a ""smart"" thermostat that doesn't require an internet connection to work. Bonus points if it looks kinds of nice.  I've got a fairly strong Z-Wave Plus network and ZigBee throughout my place.

How to monitor electrical usage of an outlet,"I just built a shed and have a through the wall ac/heater. I want to know how much it runs trying to keep the shed warm. I don't specifically need power consumed but won't avoid it, I just want cycle times.

But first I just want to see when it is pulling power and if easy enough, how much power that will work with home assistant.

I don't have any home automation set up currently but really liking how far it has come over the last several years and want to start fairly simple.

I also hate cloud and fully intend to go self hosted. I know there are a lot of devices that require using a specific app for setup. I also know there are ways to flash devices to fix that.

"Friendly Reminder - Don't use a SD card, on a PI install!","[https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/search?q=sd%20card&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/search?q=sd%20card&amp;restrict_sr=1)

I see at least a handful of threads popup every, single, week regarding ""reliability"" issues on Home Assistant.

Overall, home assistant, is actually a very reliable services to run. Nearly every single reliability issues have ONE THING in common.

They are all using a Raspberry PI, and utilizing the SD card for home assistant.

(Note- the raspberry PI itself is perfectly reliable...)

If you do this, It WILL fail, UNLESS, you do one of a few things.

1. Greatly reduce what recorder / logbook stores.
   1. [https://community.home-assistant.io/t/solved-how-to-completely-disable-recorder-history-and-logbook/122483](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/solved-how-to-completely-disable-recorder-history-and-logbook/122483)
   2. The log/recorder by default, will save all of your state changes, causing a lot of I/O on your SD card. This will burn it out eventually.
2. Run an SSD.
   1. [https://www.savjee.be/2019/12/home-assistant-boot-pi-from-usb-ssd/](https://www.savjee.be/2019/12/home-assistant-boot-pi-from-usb-ssd/)
   2. [https://community.home-assistant.io/t/finally-raspberry-pi-4-boot-from-ssd-no-microsd-required/197826](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/finally-raspberry-pi-4-boot-from-ssd-no-microsd-required/197826)
   3. Plenty of other documented methods of doing this.
3. Record data to an external database, hosted elsewhere.
   1. [https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/recorder/)
   2. Just configure your recorder to utilize a database NOT hosted on your PI's sd card.
4. Map your recorder database to a ram-disk or /tmp folder. See r/pointdextre33 in the comments.
   1. If it's not writing to your SD card, its not wearing out your SD card.

You CAN buy a high quality SD card, AND disable your recorder, which will likely make your SD card live for a very, very long time.

However- if you want to keep your recorder and history, and you don't have the option of storing it on an external server.... your SD card will eventually fail.

Before somebody chimes in and says.. ""Well, I have never done any of that, and my samsung/sandisk/etc SD card has been going strong for 5 years"", You are an exception. Not the norm. go away.

My personal advice?

Just buy a 100$ optiplex.[https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?\_from=R40&amp;\_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;\_nkw=dell+optiplex&amp;\_sacat=0](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=dell+optiplex&amp;_sacat=0)

I know that HA can interact with Philips Hue products, but can it easily do a rule along the lines of:

   * revert those same bulbs to previous settings (maybe some were off, maybe some were on with a particular colour/brightness etc)

Gcode preview in HA feat. Klipper and Moonraker,"Since Octoprint is hardly the optimal UI in this day and age, I’ve  changed to using Moonraker and interfaces based on that. This means some  parts of my Home Assistant configuration had to change.

Here’s how I got the gcode preview from Klipper websocket service Moonraker to Home Assistant:

This executes the python script placed in the local folder  /etc/homeassistant/ which is specified as the config folder. It’s  accessible to the docker container.

    #configuration.yaml
    shell_command:
      gcode_preview_py: 'python /config/imgconvert.py {{ states.sensor.klipper_preview_path.attributes[""data""] }}'

Here’s the whole printer info code, and another sensor that extracts all  the metadata from print preview. Note this takes the full size image,  as my slicer generates a smaller thumbnail too. Be sure the json  attributes path matches your slicer – this should be good for slic3r  variants such as SuperSlicer.  Big thanks to Arksine for the example.

As for the camera entity, note the placeholder image placed in the www folder, in case there’s no sensor data to display yet. 

    #cameras.yaml

        {% endif %}
      scan_interval: 5
      content_type: image/png

 The python file for doing the conversion is very simple: 

    #imgconvert.py
    import sys, base64
    imgstring = sys.argv[1]
    imgdata = base64.b64decode(imgstring)
    filename = 'www/gcode.png'
    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(imgdata)

Finally, I made an automation that calls the shell\_command, this could probably be a bit more optimized:

What's the power consumption (idle wattage) of your HA setup?,"Many people run HA on Raspberry Pis, which we all know sip power. However, once people get into HA they often get sucked into running more services and look into getting something beefier.

"Room Assistant: My iPhone 12 does not get updated, my Apple Watch does","Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I just configured Room Assistant, to try out now with only one raspberry pi 3b+ (which contains home assistant + room assistant add-on). The second raspberry pi is currently being installed and configured.

I have some problems with tracking my iPhone 12. I use bluetoothLowEnergy for it in Room Assistant, and bluetoothClassic for my Watch. 

Now the thing is: the watch updates perfectly when i walk downstairs, but since it's bluetooth Classic, it updates quite slow. So i wan't to mainly track my iPhone 12, via BLE. It is visible in Home assistant via Room Assistant &gt; MQTT Broker &gt; MQTT integration, but it does not update. When i walk downstairs, it still says i'm upstairs, while the watch says ""not\_home"" (because i have no more trackers ofcourse).

Anyone who can help me? Here is my configuration:

Tuya Zigbee Connection Issues?,"I have multiple Zigbee devices and seem to have signal issues when the distance increases from the controller (CC2530 based), but one device in particular is giving me more issues.

I have one light switch that's giving me more problems than the others, it's a Tuya 3 button switch.  and often when I operate the switch all three LEDs flash, which I believe means it's reestablishing the Zigbee link, then it works fine.  The logs do show it is reconnecting.

I have another switch that is a similar distance from the controller although another room, this one works flawlessly.  The switch that does work (in the other room) is also a different model.

Backup-Server,"Hello. I have a very basic HA setup. An old microserver running FreeNAS and in a vm HA. Currently i use verry little features, lights with motion detection mostly. But non the less, if the server is down my wife is not happy, because she needs to switch the lights for the stairs on and of at the bottom (electrical installation was not optimal).

So i do want to have a backup plan. My best idea was to use a raspi with HA set up with exactly the same configs. Since i use git for that, that should not be the biggest problem. I would need to change the ip (or set both devices to the same ip) on my router. But i'm not sure about some metrics or autoconfig (meaning devices which are not in my configuration.yaml but show nontheless, like shelly devices or my smartphones). I'm not sure if i would loose these devices.  
Since the main is not running on a raspi, it's not as simple as just copying the sd card once in a while..

"[Tutorial] Using Deepstack, Blue Iris (or any cam s/w, and Node Red to do ML motion alerts","Hello everyone,  I made a [reply earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/juusah/whats_the_coolest_new_thing_youve_added_to_your/gchbnhg/) about some of the things I do in Home Assistant.  I got asked about them so I wanted to do a quick write up.

So the **goal of this** is to get more accurate motion detection using machine learning.  My camera has TONS of false motion alerts and I know a little bit about machine learning, so of course there must be a way to analyze images and see if they are true alerts right? RIGHT! 

First and foremost, if you haven't already I highly recommend this [video from The Hook Up](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2gyzKcHbYfqoXA5xbyGXtQ) I think the users reddit name is /u/DarkbunnySC


**Now I did a few things different.** 

1) I used the new deepstack CPU friendly image which is **deepquestai/deepstack:cpu-x5-beta** this has *significantly* reduced my CPU usage.    

2) I did not use the AI Tool in the video, I use node red (hence this write up).  And my node red flow will show why.  

3) I kept my Blue Iris Web UI security turned on (vs turning it off for local access in the video) but I by passed it for a specific IP.  To do this in Blue Iris I went to Settings --&gt; Web server --&gt; Advanced And in the Limit IP addresses I put a few IP addresses.  But the format needs to be as follows:

    ^10.0.0.1, ^10.0.0.2

This would bypass authentication for those specific IPs (for example). Blue Iris will let you do entire ranges but I only wanted to skip auth for specific devices.

---


So... for **node red**, 

[Here is an image of my flow.](https://imgur.com/a/Ryinhcs). 

[And here is the raw flow export](https://zerobin.net/?c215efddd4472ade#r0V/6nks7fThttCmpMVyyd+rINbpm18Ghg1BD4YMcu4=)

---

I use node red instead of the A.I. tool because it gives me WAY MORE functionality.  I think the tool is great, but everyone has their use cases.  



So my cameras are setup with 2 streams just like in the youtube video.  If I have a camera called let's say....garage, then I would have garagehd and garagesd.

This is important because I want to trigger the HD cameras to record only when Deepstack has determined the SD variant trigger is valid.  

---
To explain my node red flow think of it like this:


1) GARAGESD Camera is triggered --&gt; Blue iris stores images in a network folder on my server.

2) Node Red sees those images in that network folder and sends them to Deepstack via HTTP REQUEST node using the POST method.

3) Deepstack checks what the image is, and returns an object value (DOG, CAT, CAR) and a confidence level between 0.00 and 1 if applicable.

4) Node Red sees the OBJECT/CONFIDENCE and based on my criteria it passes through to trigger the HD stream of the camera, or it doesn't.

--- 

A couple of notes:

In the middle of my node red flow, I have a DAY/NIGHT node.  This is simply to lower the confidence threshold at night since it is harder to tell what is on an image at night.  At night my threshold is 50 and above and during the day it is 85 and above.  


The object filter node is where I determine what things I care about...CARS, DOGS, CATS, etc.  The full list is a comment at the bottom of the node when you double click it. Edit it to your liking  

Finally at the end of the node I have a rule that if 1 camera is triggered, it triggers another camera to record.  You can delete this or use it how you please.  I also keep a copy of all pictures that were valid movement with the File Move node at the very end.


The two pink nodes at the bottom with their green msg.label counter parts are for validation.  The pink nodes will show you what images are in the folder..literally show you on the flow itself.  The left image is what was detected, and the right image is what image made it through my threshold settings.  The green msg.label node will output text of WHAT was detect (car, cat etc) right under the node itself..so no need to check the debug column.

I am sure a lot of this can be refactored.  I would be curious to see what you all come up with!!

I got asked about them so I wanted to do a quick write up.  So the **goal of this** is to get more accurate motion detection using machine learning.  My camera has TONS of false motion alerts and I know a little bit about machine learning, so of course there must be a way to analyze images and see if they are true alerts right? RIGHT!   First and foremost, if you haven't already I highly recommend this [video from The Hook Up]  I think the users reddit name is /u/DarkbunnySC   **Now I did a few things different.**   1) I used the new deepstack CPU friendly image which is **deepquestai/deepstack:cpu-x5-beta** this has *significantly* reduced my CPU usage.      2) I did not use the AI Tool in the video, I use node red (hence this write up).  And my node red flow will show why.    3) I kept my Blue Iris Web UI security turned on (vs turning it off for local access in the video) but I by passed it for a specific IP.  To do this in Blue Iris I went to Settings --> Web server --> Advanced And in the Limit IP addresses I put a few IP addresses.  But the format needs to be as follows:      ^10.0.0.1, ^10.0.0.2  This would bypass authentication for those specific IPs (for example). Blue Iris will let you do entire ranges but I only wanted to skip auth for specific devices.  ---   So... for **node red**,   [Here is an image of my flow.] .   [And here is the raw flow export]   ---  I use node red instead of the A.I. tool because it gives me WAY MORE functionality.  I think the tool is great, but everyone has their use cases.      So my cameras are setup with 2 streams just like in the youtube video.  If I have a camera called let's say....garage, then I would have garagehd and garagesd.  This is important because I want to trigger the HD cameras to record only when Deepstack has determined the SD variant trigger is valid.    --- To explain my node red flow think of it like this:   1) GARAGESD Camera is triggered --> Blue iris stores images in a network folder on my server.  2) Node Red sees those images in that network folder and sends them to Deepstack via HTTP REQUEST node using the POST method.  3) Deepstack checks what the image is, and returns an object value (DOG, CAT, CAR) and a confidence level between 0.00 and 1 if applicable.  4) Node Red sees the OBJECT/CONFIDENCE and based on my criteria it passes through to trigger the HD stream of the camera, or it doesn't.  ---   A couple of notes:  In the middle of my node red flow, I have a DAY/NIGHT node.  This is simply to lower the confidence threshold at night since it is harder to tell what is on an image at night.  At night my threshold is 50 and above and during the day it is 85 and above.     The object filter node is where I determine what things I care about...CARS, DOGS, CATS, etc.  The full list is a comment at the bottom of the node when you double click it. Edit it to your liking    Finally at the end of the node I have a rule that if 1 camera is triggered, it triggers another camera to record.  You can delete this or use it how you please.  I also keep a copy of all pictures that were valid movement with the File Move node at the very end.   The two pink nodes at the bottom with their green msg.label counter parts are for validation.  The pink nodes will show you what images are in the folder..literally show you on the flow itself.  The left image is what was detected, and the right image is what image made it through my threshold settings.  The green msg.label node will output text of WHAT was detect (car, cat etc) right under the node itself..so no need to check the debug column.  I am sure a lot of this can be refactored.  I would be curious to see what you all come up with!!

Locate system,"I've built a AI system integration with Home assistant that, for example, alerts me when a package has arrived on my front door.  This system is ALL local and does not use any cloud services.  All processing is local and secure with none of your private information leaving your internal network.  

An alert can be sent by text, email, voice, or whatever automation techniques you currently use in your Home Assistant setup.

This  system, which I call **Locate,**  stands for **L**ocal **o**bject **c**lassification **a**nd de**t**ection **e**ngine, can be used for many other situtations.

1. Say you are away from home.  You may wish to be notified if a person is in your house, and possibly use home assistant automation to take some action.
2. Possibly you want to do something should a car enter your driveway.
3. Should a person be in your backyard between the hours of 10pm and 8am, notify you and do something.

It's all about easily using home assistant to automate the actions you chose when AI detects an object you anticipated.

Update Peanut Outlet Firmware OTA through HomeAssistant,"The Peanut Outlets always seem to ship with outdated firmware. With the outdated firmware, the outlets do not properly report power usage information always displaying as 0W. Updating firmware, in the past, required use of the Almond Hub or rather complicated procedures of updating Almond firmware on a 3rd party device.

I stumbled upon some discussion on GitHub ([https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/issues/522](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy/issues/522)) regarding OTA firmware updates on ZHA devices through HomeAssistant and got it working for my outlets. I figured there may be others here who would like to update theirs without having to purchase more hardware to do so.

# Setup

First, a configuration change in HA is required to enable the OTA updates. Create a new directory on your system accessible by HA and then add the following to configuration.yaml. I don't use any IKEA or Ledvance deices so I explicitly disabled their auto updating.

    zha:
      zigpy_config:
        ota:
          ikea_provider: false
          ledvance_provider: false
          otau_directory: /path/to/your/ota/folder

Logging is useful for ZHA to ensure that it is working.

    logger:
      default: warn
      logs:
        homeassistant.components.zha: debug
        bellows.zigbee.application: debug
        bellows.ezsp: debug
        zigpy: debug
        zigpy_cc: debug
        zigpy_deconz.zigbee.application: debug
        zigpy_deconz.api: debug
        zigpy_xbee.zigbee.application: debug
        zigpy_xbee.api: debug
        zigpy_zigate: debug
        zigpy_znp: debug
        zhaquirks: debug

# Firmware File

Next, you need the newer firmware. I haven't found a direct link online, but someone posted the file on GitHub: [https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-OTA/raw/master/images/Tuya/ZPS\_CS5490\_039.ota](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-OTA/raw/master/images/Tuya/ZPS_CS5490_039.ota)

Place the .ota file in the directory you created earlier.

Restart HomeAssistant in order to activate the configuration changes.

# Updating Through HomeAssistant

The IEEE address of the plug is required in order to issue commands on the zigbee network. Find the device information in the ZHA integration.

Integrations -&gt; ZHA -&gt; Devices -&gt; (The Plug)

And reference the IEEE address of the plug under ""Device Info"" -&gt; ""Zigbee Info""

Next, access the HomeAssistant Developer Tools -&gt; Services tab.

Call the following service using the supplied values below in order to trigger the plug to request an OTA firmware update:

zha.set\_zigbee\_cluster\_attribute

    ieee: '&lt;The device IEEE&gt;'
    endpoint_id: 1 
    cluster_id: 5 
    attribute: 2 
    cluster_type: out
    value: 49502

And press the ""Call Service"" button.

Once invoked, the process will take a long time (i.e. 5-10 minutes). With debug logging enabled, the log will be flooded with transmission requests and confirmations during this time.

If you want to tail and grep the log, there is a percentage output:

    DEBUG (MainThread) [zigpy.zcl] [0x57cf:1:0x0019] OTA upgrade progress: 2.6

After the update completes, the device will have the wattage output properly reported in HomeAssistant. Additionally, the Device in ZHA seems to gain ""Firmware: 0x00000027"" in the ZHA integration. The stock firmware didn't list this at all.",r/homeassistant,2020-11-16 18:36:12,Update Peanut Outlet Firmware OTA through HomeAssistant,"The Peanut Outlets always seem to ship with outdated firmware.

I have a quick question about the Lutron Caseta dimmer switches,"I have HA running on a pi 3. I recently noticed that if I turn on a light using the wall switch, the light won't register in HA as being turned on. I have some automations that are triggered by the state of some of these lights, so these are broken.

I always had motion sensors and automations to turn my lights on and off and very rarely ever touched the switches, but I recently ended up getting a roommate and turned most of those automations off as to not freak him out, so I don't know if this is a new behaviour or if I'm just noticing it?

Reload Automations - Delay Actions &amp; Wait For Triggers," I'm using Delay and Wait For actions in many of my automations. Basic example, turn on driveway light at sunset, wait for time 23:59:59, turn off light.

I thought I was being clever in many of my automations by including delays and wait for triggers so that I could cut 2 automations into 1, but I'm finding as I tinker more and more - that the ""Reload Automations"" function necessary after making automation changes actually screws up many automations that are in the process of running with delays and wait for's.

Has anyone found a way around this? Or do I actually need to go back to having more than 1 automation that excludes the delay/wait for stuff?

With the example of the above, if a Reload Automation is called anytime between sunset and midnight, that light will not turn off at midnight. Do I need to go to 2 auto's here, 1 to turn off and 1 to turn on? Seems odd that the system can't retain the running automation.

"Two home assistant hubs, different locations","Has anyone come up with a good solution for having two HA set up in different locations and controlling them easily from the HA app?

I’m looking to have the ir transmission increase the number of repeats it does by the number of ir signals it receives in the last x seconds. so if I press the volume up once, it just increases the volume by 1, but if I hold the volume up button down the volume increases to ramp up (ie volume increases by 1 the first time, volume increases by 2 the second time, volume increases by 3 the third time)

has anyone does something similar or have any direction I could go in?",r/homeassistant,2020-11-16 09:32:33,[ESPHome] Scaling ir transmission repeats based on ir received,"Hi all,  Issue:   To control my amp using one remote, I configured my lg tv magic remote to transmit ir signals which I capture using esphome and transmit the correct ir signal to my amp.

"Show icon from entity state, use toggle from another ($10 to the winner)","I'm looking at making some sort of template button thing to make my setup work. I'm very new to this so I'm willing to PayPal $10 for the correct code.

I basically want a button showing the icon from cover.garage_door state (uses MyQ sensor to show up or down) but when I tap on the button I want it to toggle entity: switch.sonoff_1000439309.

The sonoff is a wifi relay used to open/shut the door. 

What's the exact code needed to make this work? I'm willing to PayPal $10 for the right code to make this work :)
